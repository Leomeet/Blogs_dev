    "title": "Book Review: My Age of Anxiety by Scott Stossel",
    "description": "By Kelly  ToddBy Scott StosselKnopf (2013)As editor of , author of multiple books and a happily married family man, some might say Scott Stossel is the picturesque portrayal of happiness in our society. His kind and gentle demeanor even earned him the nickname “human Xanax” around his friends because of the calming nature of his personality. The nickname, as Stossel points out, is almost comically ironic. With his book , Stossel “comes out,” as he puts it, by revealing to the world his actual experience with anxiety which he long sought to hide.Taking on the role of an individual affected by  (as opposed to the finite role of a scholar, psychologist or scientist, he says) Stossel was able to create a unique blend of genres in his book. His book combines the “history, literature, philosophy, religion, popular culture and recent scientific research” of anxiety, sewn together with his own interweaving personal narrative. The stories which he shares with his readers range from heart breaking recollections of his great-grandfather, who was committed to the famous McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass. for acute anxiety, to some seemingly bizarre treatments Stossel has faced on his almost four decade long journey with anxiety, including a failed experience with ipecac to cure him of his phobia of vomiting and lots and lots of vodka.Beginning at the age of 6 and continuing until present day, Stossel has found himself affected by one type of anxiety or another. He has faced panic attacks, phobias, social anxiety, performance anxiety and generalized anxiety, just to name a few. Because of his anxiety, Stossel has tried a variety of treatments including , family and group therapy, hypnosis, meditation and medication. This novel, he writes, is just another way for him to address and (hopefully) come to terms with his anxiety. He explores the history, science and research surrounding his condition in order to shed light for both himself and others on what “anxiety” truly is and what it means to be living with this condition.Stossel’s book could function effectively as a guide to anyone affected by anxiety. His weaving narrative and scholastic descriptions lead the reader on an entertaining and educational journey through the intricacies of anxiety. In his book Stossel first addresses the enigmatic nature of anxiety as a diagnosis. Anxiety only become recognized as a diagnostic category 35 years ago. To this day, the majority of people who diagnose or experience this condition define it differently.Stossel elaborates on the history of anxiety, looking at it from the psychological, social and biological frames of thought. He goes on to write about the effect anxiety has had on his body physically, including vignettes about his nervous stomach and an academic analysis of how anxiety changes ones brain function. His chapter on anxiolytic medication is extremely well researched and is peppered with his own trials and tribulations with medication. Towards the end of the book Stossel reflects on biology once more as he contemplates the nature versus nurture debate, the role genetics may play in anxiety and what this may mean for his children.In the final chapter of his book, Stossel looks once more at what it means to him to experience anxiety. The conclusions he draws could resonate with anyone, whether they experience extreme anxiety or have never experienced it at all. One in five people, he writes, will experience anxiety at some point in their lifetime. With this book as your guide you can come to understand this condition that impacts so many people and one man’s journey toward reconciliation.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "We Got Game: RPG Limit Break Video Game Marathon",
    "description": "By Katrina  GayThink “video gamer” and many will stereotypically assume these are either aimless kids or adult children living out of their parent’s basement, eating potato chips and soda for hours with game consoles in their hands, eyes glued to monitor screens. But did you know 70 percent of America’s households play video games, with the average age of a gamer at 34? And that 40 percent of all gamers are female?If it is true that we develop stereotypes to fill in the blanks when we lack the total picture, then one way of dispelling them is to fill in the information gaps. Ask a true dedicated gamer why they play and they may talk about games as one of the most creative mediums available, or that the community offers so much acceptance along with challenge or that it is a social hobby that brings joy and pleasure.Regardless of the reasons, gamers are a vibrant, active community, comprising nearly 170 million Americans, about the same as baseball fans, and nearly 33 million are console gamers.A specific type of video game, a role-playing game (RPG), is a game in which each participant assumes the role of a character, generally in a fantasy or science fiction setting that can interact within the game's imaginary world.\r\nA speedrun marathon for RPGs of all kinds,  is an upcoming online event in which many RPGs will be completed as quickly as possible in succession. The gamers gather at one venue to speedrun games together, in this case over the course of several days, gaming for more than 100 hours. Spectators can watch the feed of the game, usually along with a live feed of the player and others, including a commentator who is broadcasting the event, live over the Internet through a service such as Twitch. Others can also follow activity via  and via , hashtagging #gamer as well as #HopeStartsWithYou.So what exactly does the upcoming speedrun marathon, RPG Limit Break, have to do with NAMI? Well, the reality is that that many gamers are actually quite attuned to the benefits of giving back to others. In a marathon such as this, viewers will be invited to donate to NAMI and pledge with certain incentives, often integrating into the game as a character or activity to promote interaction.The RPG Limit Break event is hosted in Salt Lake City, Utah, and will be streamed live over the course of several days, starting on May 12, 2 p.m. ET, and scheduled to end the evening of May 16. The event will be broadcasted on their . 100 percent of donations go to NAMI and NAMI Utah. If you want to know what games are being played and when, you can see the full schedule I had the opportunity to talk via email last week to the event host, Brian Cook, online gamer handle Brossentia, about the marathon.  Speedrunning is an activity where people push games to their limit to see how fast a game can be completed. Many speedruns of games push speed to the limit like this  while others break the game apart with glitches like this  (a little language in the video). As a community, hundreds if not thousands of hours go into finding the fastest way to complete a game.\r\n.RPG Limit Break focuses on role-playing games. In general, these games tend to be story-driven, and many can take 30 to 40 hours for someone to finish the game for the first time. Attendees of this event will complete 32 RPGs back-to-back over the course of 5 days. Most will be played by one person, but a few, such as the four-way race with , will involve multiple people.The entire gaming marathon will be streamed 24/7 online at both  and . During that time, viewers are invited to donate towards NAMI; each donation can be put towards an incentive, often something that is either fun or makes the runners' games more difficult.Months before the marathon begins, we open up game submissions. Anyone is allowed to submit a game, a video, and a description of why it would be an exciting game for the marathon. This year, 115 different speedruns were submitted for consideration. Several staff members read through the submissions and watch videos to decide what they feel would work best. Once the game list is created, those who made it into the schedule are invited to run their games in the marathon.Many of the runners are also there volunteering with speedrun commentating, donation processing, manning the tech station, and driving people around the city. We have a special community; even if we don't know someone in person, we often help each other out.I personally tend to speedrun bad video games. That's my niche. I find it fun to show off games that are so bad they're funny. Most of them don't make it into marathons, but I can usually weasel in one or two of these terrible games.Also, my brother-in-law is extremely excited about feeding people at the event. I think we'll all need a diet once this marathon is over.Most online observers will watch a high-quality stream with the game, streamer, and on-site audience in full view. We put a lot of effort into commentary and making sure people watching the speedrun understand what's happening. Throughout the marathon, donation comments will be read, and viewers will have the chance to win prizes when they donate at specific times.For those who haven't seen a marathon before, I highly recommend watching the  speedrun Wednesday afternoon. Tons of people have played this game, but because of extremely broken game physics, the game is completed in under an hour. I'm always baffled by how broken the most beautiful games can be.Throughout the marathon, we have several prizes that we'll give out randomly to those who donate. The Yetee is also having a shirt sale with part of the proceeds going to NAMI. In addition, people can donate to name characters in games, to add challenges, and to sometimes completely choose what route the runner takes in a marathon. For example, with , you can play as three different people, but the runner will only play as the one that wins the bid war.The whole idea of marathons started with a group of gamers called The Speed Gamers; although they weren't as concerned with impressive gameplay, they still made enjoyable streams that contributed to charity. Mike Uyama and others at Speed Demos Archive, one of the first speedrunning sites, decided they wanted to hold a similar charity event that would showcase runners' skill. Because of this, they held the first speedrunning marathon, Classic Games Done Quick. I was not a speedrunner at the time, but my sister ran a game there. They raised just over $10,000 for that first marathon, much more than anyone expected.I became involved with this main group, and the success has been unbelievable. These marathons have become the largest gaming charity events in the world with Awesome Games Done Quick raising more than $1.5 million.A large reason why these speedrunning charity events appeared is because of a desire to give back. Gamers often have a stigma as selfish, greedy and lonely people. The media has repeatedly branded games as a reason that children become violent. However, many gamers become wonderful people and we want to show others how much anyone can change the world.Sure, there is competition, and speedrunning is starting to become a more mainstream kind of activity. Anyone can speedrun a game. In the same way, anyone is invited to participate in these charitable events and give back to the community.Most if not all of us have some connection to mental illness in one way or another. People like to shove mental illness under the rug, but doing that only causes more harm, more pain. I myself struggle with depression, but I've especially struggled with being able to talk about it. I always wanted to be someone who was strong enough to take care of myself. However, that meant going through some of my darkest moments alone. I think true strength is knowing when you need to reach out, and I wish I believed that sooner. NAMI helps people share their experiences and seek help; NAMI helps our culture change and accept others for who they are.NAMI helps us know that it's okay to talk.Our current goal is to raise $30,000 for NAMI. We're always a little afraid of putting a number; we believe any amount of charity is worth the effort, but we also want to keep our expectations high. I think the biggest success will come with the stories and the courage that people take from this. Already, I've had two people send me some stories about their journeys with mental illness. Many moments were heart-wrenching, but they both managed to find a world where they felt accepted. If people leave either with a desire to help or the strength to find help, we will have succeeded.Planning has been intense, but we're at the point where all this work is coming together! I want to thank NAMI for allowing us this chance to work with them. May we all create hope for others.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "How the Mental Health Community Can Support Black Mental Health",
    "description": "By Caitlin C.  ReganOver the past two years, the modern civil rights movement has brought to the forefront a long-overdue racial reckoning in the U.S. The advancing conversation about race in America has been powerful for me as a mental health and substance use counselor.As a white woman, I cannot begin to understand the realities of being a Black person in America, and I recognize the inherent privilege I was born with and have lived with every day since. However, I believe that I — along with other individuals living with mental illness — can empathize with anyone experiencing discrimination and injustice. And I believe I have a responsibility, as a provider, to help dismantle disparities in mental health care and support Black mental health.As a woman living with Bipolar II disorder, a condition that is often misrepresented in media and misunderstood by the general public, I am familiar with some of the realities of discrimination.Many of us who live with mental health conditions know the pain of being unjustly deemed “unstable” or “dangerous” by law enforcement. We are familiar with critical stares. We have missed out on job opportunities or lost hard-earned jobs at the judgment of biased hiring managers and employers. We also experience  of incarceration.Of course, discrimination against people with mental health conditions and discrimination against people of color are not comparable. I have the luxury of “hiding” this part of my identity for my own protection — my mental illness is not (immediately) visible. I do not have to fear for my safety jogging down the street, walking into a store or driving my car.Not only are they not comparable, these two facets of discrimination often compound each other for people of color with mental illness — who are often  group in the mental health care system.So, the question becomes how do we — people living with a mental illness and working in the mental health field — address this inequality and better support Black mental health?As a former teacher, and currently as a clinician, I work almost exclusively with adolescents — often adolescents of color. My job, as I understand it, is to meet my students and clients wherever they are coming from. I offer my support and acknowledge that while I may have a different lived experience, my goal is to empathize and help. Ultimately, it is not their job to learn to trust me. It is my job to earn their respect and trust.Here are a few ways providers can earn their clients’ respect and trust and begin to dismantle the disparities in care for the Black community.\r\nOne step toward becoming a better supporter is acknowledging that we won’t always fully understand another person’s experience. Supporting a movement and validating someone’s experience does not require a personal familiarity with their lived experience. Instead, it requires a willingness to listen, learn and change our behavior accordingly.\r\nMental health care professionals can further support Black mental health by looking into their own practices, acknowledging their biases and altering their care accordingly. Ultimately, every client who walks through the door deserves to be met with empathy and cultural understanding.\r\nIn addition to investigating our own biases, practitioners must educate themselves on health disparities between groups. A 2008  found that white individuals have more access to quality mental health support and professional help — and they are met with more empathy when seeking treatment.\r\nClinicians should consider socioeconomic inequalities when determining practice fees. Adjusted rates could be a step toward presenting better care opportunities for people of color who seek mental health treatment. Some private practices and facilities currently use sliding fee scales, charging clients based on what is doable for their household income rather than a flat rate fee. This is a start and needs to be adopted by all of the mental health world, including hospitalization facilities.\r\nThe mental health care system also needs to keep up with the appropriate language to use in a clinical setting. Clinicians, support groups and anyone engaging in a dialogue about mental health need to consider the inherent trauma that people of color have lived generationally in order to provide unbiased, nonjudgmental support. Using a dated term or unfamiliar language can be incredibly triggering for someone who has experienced severe discrimination and marginalization.\r\nYearly trainings and seminars can help providers better understand cultural triggers. Clinicians, support groups and non-profits need to continually undergo cultural understanding and awareness trainings to stay at the forefront of the discourse and to provide the best, culturally competent care.As a clinician who lives with a mental health disorder, I have taken a personal journey to work toward cultural competence and empathy for all my clients. I do not always get it right — and in those moments, it is critical to recognize my mistakes and work to address it with my client. Often, an apology can go a long way. But this means very little without understanding and measurable growth.In my practice, I continually participate in webinars and trainings for cultural competence, and I devote time to reading on the topic on my own. “Social Justice in Clinical Practice” by Belkin Martinez and Fleck-Henderson has added to my understanding of injustices occurring in the medical space and more broadly, and it has given me a blueprint for how I, as a white clinician, can work to restore social justice in my practice and beyond.Having cultural competence and empathy, to me, does not mean simply addressing the issue in my practice, but speaking up on a larger scale. It is when those of privilege stay silent that injustice prevails. This always plays in my mind in order to work toward change.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "By Luna  GreensteinTraveling has countless benefits: learning, exploring, trying new things, to name just a few. As the quote goes, “Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer.” Every adventure can be a life experience, worth the time, money and even the potential conflicts.When leaving your usual routine and entering new territory, challenges might come up. One challenge is that traveling may cause symptoms of a mental health condition to flare. Even though being symptomatic isn’t completely avoidable, here are a few tips on how to reduce stress and manage symptoms during a trip:Being spontaneous while traveling is part of the fun, but a little bit of planning can save a lot of hassle. , so trying to prevent stressful situations is important. Here are a few ways to prepare:  Plan time in your itinerary to rest and recuperate, especially if you are packing activities into everyday. This will allow you to process your new experiences and prevent you from feeling overwhelmed. Also, many major airlines offer day passes to their lounges for a fee. Lounges provide a much quieter, more relaxing experience than waiting in the hustle at the gate.Whether you are strolling around a museum or lounging on the beach, you should keep your medication with you.

    "description": "President Obama submitted his proposed federal budget for 2013 to Congress this week. As expected, it’s controversial. Much of the debate leading into the fall’s elections will be over what programs should be cut and how much taxes should be raised—if at all—on high income Americans in order to reduce the federal government’s deficit, let alone pay down the national debt.As part of the debate, there will be choices important to individuals and families affected by mental illness, regardless of political party. Mental illness does not discriminate. It affects Republicans, Democrats and Independents alike.For example, the President’s proposal  in Medicare and Medicaid payments over 10 years, in part by cutting payments to providers. It also would freeze the National Institutes of Health budget, which is the source for scientific research into mental illness. Along with disability income, housing and other practical needs, these areas make the difference for treatment and recovery.The squeeze on Medicaid especially affects state mental health care systems. In November, 2012, NAMI released a  that outlined the impact of that squeeze, along with state budget cuts.Expect state budget crises to continue. This past week, debate in several states and the impact of cuts—and rising demand—filled headlines in , ,  and . In Florida, posted  of a protest that raised public awareness of the local impact of a proposed $91 million cut in state mental health care.“If I didn’t have this service, I probably would be homeless,” Jeffrey Vassey, a 55-year-old man living with schizophrenia told the paper.Budget debates speak in terms of trillions, billions, millions and thousands of dollars, depending on the size of the community—national, state or local.It’s easy to lose perspective.At the ground level, however, the perspective is easy. Mental health care often makes the difference between living on the streets and moving toward recovery.

    "description": "Since my first involvement in 1988, nearly everyone I have spoken to in NAMI has described their dream of a time when mental illness can be discussed in public as an important issue worthy of public support and understanding. I began to understand the significance of these dreams and soon started dreaming of the same thing myself.From the very beginning of the NAMI movement, part of the challenge was always the need to educate the public about serious mental illness—to let people know that mental illness, like diabetes and heart disease is an illness like any other, that it is indiscriminate in nature, that recovery is possible when the appropriate treatment is available, and that NAMI provides hope for individuals with a serious mental illness, for their families and for their communities.This challenge seemed insurmountable at times. By the beginning of the 21st century, NAMI had built an extensive and powerful national network of advocates and the capacity to begin to initiate the conversations necessary to help people better understand the impact that mental illness has on their community. What was needed was a vehicle that allowed advocates to initiate these conversations on a scale that would begin to make a difference. The NAMIWalk program has provided the perfect opportunity to begin these important conversations.NAMIWalks marks its 10th anniversary in 2012. Since its beginning, NAMIWalks has grown significantly and has become a “community walk for mental illness awareness” and the perfect way to engage every part of the communities that host these events. As each of these walks continues to grow, the opportunities to educate the public and to change the way people see serious mental illness will grow as well. We are approaching the point when these walks stop being so much about ‘walking for NAMI’ and more about ‘communities walking to raise awareness about mental illness.’ As that happens, some of our long held dreams will begin to come true.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "I always hesitate to write about music. It tends to date me. My kids roll their eyes whenever I mention the 1970s, let alone folk rock. In the car, there’s a constant battle over which radio stations or CDs to play.Every now and then, however, there’s a song that resonates and bridges the generational divide. These days, the song is  by the band fun. It strikes a chord somehow with teenage angst and inspires my own kids to rally forward.“Carry On” strikes a chord in me as well, rooted in past battles with depression. Its message is an exhortation, a call to arms and an affirmation of faith. It also has caused me to remember the song that touched me when I was 16 years old—long before I learned that my moodiness was only a hint of worst things to come. Arlo Guthrie sang , which is partly about coming of age in the tumultuous decade between 1961 and 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther songs reflect the same theme. In 2001, Gospel singer Yolanda Adams’   was a call for personal perseverance, but also provided encouragement and hope to a stunned, grief-stricken nation after the terrorist attacks of 9/11.An important distinction is that such songs are inspirational in nature, encouraging listeners to draw on inner strength. They don’t wallow in sadness or pain. I’ve always liked Gilbert O’Sullivan’s  “,” but face it, the fact that in the lyrics, he is on his way to throw himself off a tower doesn’t do much for inspiring a person to hold on.From a biological perspective, music can calm stress and elevate mood by increasing levels of serotonin or dopamine in the brain. Music can literally lift and energize a person’s spirits, helping to overcome anxiety or depression.Tunes and lyrics also stir memories. Music from a pleasurable time and place can therapeutically put people living with depression “back in touch” with important parts of themselves, helping to pull them out of isolation inside their own minds.Thirty years ago, I was struggling with depression, unemployed and disconnected from most of my friends who lived in other cities. Turning points in my recovery came when a close college friends stopped for a night en route from Vermont to Michigan. As we talked into the night, he put one of my records on stereo— by the Beatles—which we had listened to many times together several years before. One song was particularly apt:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that moment I realized that it had been over a year since I had listened to music for music’s sake. It had been part of my withdrawal from the world and suppression of my energy and strength.Turning the music back on helped turn me back on.It doesn’t matter what decade you’re from. Carry on. Don’t ever give up the fight.Share your strength.Tell us the songs that inspire you.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "The First Lady of Mental Health ",
    "description": "Last week, I had the opportunity to meet briefly with former first lady Rosalynn Carter in Atlanta after she filmed a public service announcement in support of NAMI Georgia’s  initiative. “Please help … build a circle of support in your community and put self-directed recovery within our reach,” Mrs. Carter asked.Gracious, genuine, committed—as I watched her speak these were some of the words that came to mind. I reflected on this amazing woman and her role in changing our global understanding of mental illness.Mrs. Carter was the first wife of a presidential candidate to declare a campaign promise of her own. Her promise? As first lady, she would assume the responsibility for guiding legislative reform on behalf of the nation’s individuals living with mental illness.Expanding on efforts she initiated as first lady of Georgia, this is exactly what she did after her husband was elected President in 1976. This is remarkable on its own, but to put this in perspective, to say that America’s awareness of mental illness was very much in the dark in the 70s is an understatement; treatment options were in most cases nonexistent and mothers were blamed for their children’s mental illness. To further demonstrate the reality of this era, NAMI was not founded until 1979, three years after Carter’s inauguration.A true pioneer, Mrs. Carter’s compassion and dedication on behalf of individuals and families affected by mental illness has not wavered in the more than 35 years since. Even a partial list of her accomplishments in this arena is eye-opening:Her drive to aid individuals living with mental illness all began during a 1966 encounter early one morning while campaigning for her husband’s bid to become governor of Georgia. Mrs. Carter came upon a stooped and weary woman heading home to care for a daughter with mental illness. She was so moved by her love and dedication that she launched a personal crusade that continues today.From the world stage to a corner of her home state, last week, more than 45 years later, she reminds us that we have a lifetime champion who will embrace all efforts, large and small, in support of improving our lives, our families and our communities.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Enough is Enough: Regulate Restraint and Seclusion in Schools ",
    "description": "The need to regulate restraint and seclusion in our nation’s schools just gained significant momentum with the release of a new report and an NPR  that highlights the need for immediate action. ProPublica  released by the U.S. Department of Education showing that there were 267,000 instances of restraining or secluding children in schools in one school year. The NPR article highlights an incident in which a young boy with autism panicked after being threatened with seclusion. When school officials tried to force him into the “quiet area” a small locked room, bones in his hand were crushed.Despite claims that schools are limiting the use of restraint and seclusion, these unacceptably high numbers suggest otherwise. Some schools reported restraining or secluding students dozens and even hundreds of times each year. In 75 percent of these cases, restraint and seclusion was used with children with a disability including mental illness. Many of these instances of restraint and seclusion were improperly used when an emergency did not exist.Congress has introduced The Keeping All Students Safe Act (, ) to protect children from the unnecessary and harmful use of restraint and seclusion. This legislation allows restraint to be used when a student’s behavior poses an immediate danger of physical harm to that student or anyone else. For example a student may be restrained if they are striking other students, banging their head against the wall, “gouging their eyes”, or other related behaviors. In cases when restraint is used, the bill requires schools to notify the child’s parents and work with them to plan ways to better manage difficult behaviors in the future. The Keeping All Students Safe Act fosters a positive learning environment in schools by promoting interventions that help minimize disruptive classroom behaviors and instructing school staff in more effective ways of addressing students who may be in crisis.Momentum is building for this legislation and we urge you to be a part by  to ask for their support and to use their leadership to move the legislation forward to a vote.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "American Idol: Singing Against Stigma ",
    "description": "It takes courage for a person to talk about living with a mental illness.That’s especially the case if you are a teenager.Even more so when disclosure takes place in front of a television audience of millions on the hit show On Jan. 25, 17-year-old  of Mankato, Minnesota “wowed” the American Idol judges in an audition that featured a video about her struggle with bipolar disorder.Shelby has lived with depression since she was in fourth grade. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in March 2011. Singing, she believes, has helped her to persevere.“I want to show people that  doesn’t define who you are,” she said. In doing so, she has struck a powerful blow against stigma and discrimination.NAMI members cheered and applauded in their living rooms. For those who were watching with their parents or teenage children, it was an emotional moment.The moment carried even greater emotion as Shelby sang “Temporary Home” by Carrie Underwood. The refrain can serve as a metaphor in the journey toward recovery:Both the video and vocal performance can be seen on many websites, including Talking publicly about your mental illness not only can help strike a blow against stigma, it can be part of recovery itself. It can liberate a person from feelings of stigma. It can stop a person from internalizing shame or fear. Besides being a step toward recovery taken for herself, Shelby’s audition serves as an example that can inspire others. That’s one of the principles on which NAMI’s public education program  also rests.So what happens next?The audition judges selected Shelby to compete as a semi-finalist in Hollywood. Contestants will be eliminated until a winner is selected by the audience in the final episode in May.I think NAMI members will know who they want to vote for.Keep singing, Shelby.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!
