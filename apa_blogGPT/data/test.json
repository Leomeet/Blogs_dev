    "title": " Gender Bias and the Patriarchy’s Impact on Mental Health Advocacy",
    "description": "By Meggin  Rose\r\nDespite social progress and political movements to dismantle the pervasive gender bias in our culture, misogyny has had — and continues to have — a significant impact on the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness.The mental health system, like many institutions, was built by men in a time when women were considered the “weaker sex” — physically, intellectually and emotionally.Historically, women were often dismissed or disregarded by their health care providers — they were deemed “hysterical,” and any symptoms of anxiety and depression were attributed not to the oppression or lack of agency in their own lives, but to their fragility, incapacity and “wandering wombs.”Some of the first psychotherapists also claimed that mental illness in a child was a direct result of how they were mothered — essentially blaming women for “causing” mental illness.Currently, if you identify as a woman, chances are you have had one or more occasions of feeling dismissed, disregarded or even objectified by a health care provider.Perhaps you were even taught that being polite and compliant was more important than having your health needs met. If you are a mother, you may feel a sense of guilt if your child is struggling and may even blame yourself.To continue changing this harmful narrative, we must turn to advocacy. There are steps we can take in our own lives to demand and model better treatment for ourselves and for our families when it comes to mental health care.Advocacy often begins on the individual level. More recently, people who identify as women are learning to speak up about what we want and need when we work with any health care providers. As we learn more about the mind-body connection, we can voice our concerns and reject the notion that symptoms are “all in our head.” We can get a second opinion rather than settling for a “fallback” diagnosis when we feel something is not right with us.We can also use the widely available health information from reliable online sources to ask more informed questions. This has encouraged me to better monitor my tests results and helped me to better advocate for myself. For example, I have flagged irregular bloodwork results to my providers on several occasions, which altered my treatment plan and improved my health.We must remember that we are the consumers of our care — we are the reason why providers are giving care. Recognizing this, we can come to appointments with a prepared personal health agenda, ask questions, demand to be heard and expect to be believed and respected. If our doctors cannot accommodate this, we must seek new ones.As women continue to take on the role as the primary caregiver of children, we should be heard and believed when we describe our child’s symptoms to a pediatrician. Parent-caregivers are the experts on their young children.We should be partners with providers on our child’s treatment plan, medication adherence and follow-up care.This provides an opportunity for us to be powerful advocates by:When my loved-one became ill, I had to learn how to be a mental health advocate. Between fighting with health insurance over payment for a covered medication, to researching treatments and developing a working relationship with the little mental health care we could engage, it was almost a full-time job.We may be emotional, and that is fine; it is not weak or hysterical — it is a healthy response to a terrible situation in which we have very little control over the life and health of our loved one.I have barely scratched the surface on the issue of gender bias and patriarchy in mental health care. I haven’t talked about our amazing allies who identify as male.I haven’t talked about the outstanding providers I have had the privilege to work with.I also haven’t dealt with the devastating gap in mental health care because of racism, classism and level of academic achievement.But I am focused on raising the issue for further debate and research, and for helping to name one of the obstacles we, as women, run into as advocates for our loved ones in a world plagued by patriarchy and inequity.\r\n We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "5 Truths I Discovered on My Road to Recovery",
    "description": "By Cindy  Tillory\r\nI’m at a point in my recovery where I feel more comfortable in my thoughts and behaviors. I understand my health and my needs — and I have a more relaxed attitude toward life. But this wasn’t always the case.In 2012, I was struggling. I had lost my mother a year before, and I wasn’t handling the loss well. I needed to be hospitalized and was put under psychiatric evaluation for six months.As I look back on my mental health journey, I often think about the many roadblocks I could have avoided if I had simply known a few basic truths and tips. These are a few truths I learned on my road to recovery.Self-blame is a problem for many of us living with mental illness — I have dealt with it often. This tendency, I learned in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), is a common cognitive distortion — a thought pattern that is often inaccurate and negatively biased.My thought pattern manifested in me blaming myself whenever anything went wrong. Yes, there were things that may have been within my control that had been mismanaged, but most things I blamed myself for— namely, my mental illness and accompanying symptoms — weren’t the same as what I could actually control.Now, I am careful to analyze distressing situations as they arise, determining if the circumstances are something I can control. I have come to understand that I can control my own actions and responses, but I cannot control external events or hold myself responsible for others’ feelings and actions.Throughout my mental health journey, I battled another cognitive distortion: black-and-white thinking. When I would engage in black-and-white thinking, I could only interpret events in extremes; I believed that everyone and everything fell into two different categories, Good and Bad. Thinking this way forced me to divide my world and miss out on the nuances of life and the complexities of people. &I saw everyone as either a “good guy” or “bad guy” — and in the depths of my mental illness, I could only see certain people as the enemy. This often put me in a victim mindset, and I would make decisions and act out of fear and perceived danger. Thankfully my time spent in therapy has broken down that barrier and has allowed me to see that in the end, people are just people, and not everything is good or bad.Perhaps the most important lesson I learned is that treatment can be most effective when it is a collaborative process. You and your mental health professionals are a team. At the beginning of my journey, I simply took the medication that was given to me by my medical providers. I was never an active participant in my treatment.I never spoke up about negative side effects of medications or articulated my goals for recovery. As a result, I didn’t see the outcomes I wanted, so I would stop taking my medication. Slowly, my condition would deteriorate even further. I often lied to my doctors and told them I was taking the medication, rather than admitting that the side effects had become too much to handle. I seemed outwardly compliant, but I was harming myself by not voicing my concerns.Once I started to be honest with my doctor, we adjusted my medication to find a better fit. This, combined with regular therapy got me closer to the current point in my recovery. I wish I could tell my younger self that she could speak up at any time, ask questions and advocate for herself. Always remember: You are the priority in your own treatment.I believe that there is dignity in working and accomplishing tasks. And, like most of us, I was raised in a culture that valued hard work and success. But I have also learned that managing my energy — when I have too much or too little — is a critical part of my recovery. Self-care and productivity, I’ve learned, can coexist in a healthy balance.To find this balance, I had to recognize that I had a bad habit of tying my productivity and my accomplishments to my self-worth. When I would have a busy or productive day, I felt more “useful” and considered myself “good”— somehow superior to the person I was on the days when I didn’t do anything. However, the height of my “productivity” occurred during my manic episodes — it was never focused or sustainable.Now, I understand that I am not “better” when I am manic. I am better when I allow myself to rest and find consistent, healthy habits.I love the arts. Drawing and painting were always my favorite classes in high school. There’s something magical about creating art — and it has always helped me to limit my symptoms. The process of creating art has also alleviated much of my social anxiety — a phenomenon that is backed by . Early on in my mental health journey, I remember that I first found relief in art therapy groups. Even on my darker days, art provided a bright spot.Now, I try to work art projects into my self-care routine. I schedule at least an hour each week for creating. My work doesn’t have to be perfect — no painting ever is. It simply needs to fill me with joy, excitement and gratitude.Since receiving my first diagnosis, I have made leaps and bounds in my self-awareness and recovery. The people I have met, and the changes I have made to my life, have allowed me to be a more caring, informed and well-rounded individual. Through therapy and self-care, I have become a person empowered to make her own choices in life.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "By Carole  Wills It’s incredibly unfortunate that some people judge and blame those who live with major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, PTSD, schizophrenia or any other mental illness for the symptoms they experience. Our goal during this important month of awareness is to address these attitudes and ask the questions: How do we change society’s thinking about biologically based mood and thought disorders? How do we remove barriers to treatment created by fear and ignorance?One of NAMI FaithNet’s pioneers, Gunnar Christiansen, gives us the key: “Education leads to understanding; understanding leads to empathy; empathy leads to compassionate care. We don’t need to be a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a neuroscientist or a theologian. We simply need boots on the ground.” He was talking about the need for champions and advocates like you and me to speak up, to educate, to raise awareness, to end the silence about mental health issues in our families, work place, schools and faith communities.A young woman came up to me recently during a break at mental health ministry training for the Catholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis. Her eyes searched mine intensely as she shared that, after many years of struggle, she recently and finally had been diagnosed with Bipolar II. “Thank you for telling us about NAMI. [I’d] never heard of it or NAMI FaithNet before.” As I told her about NAMI support groups and education courses near her, a smile lit her face.Whom will you tell that NAMI offers hope and help through education courses and support groups, that mental illnesses are treatable and that early diagnosis and treatment lead to better outcomes? May is Mental Health Month, and the time is right. Gather your tools to spread education and awareness.Here are awareness resources for bulletin boards, newsletter articles, small discussion groups or large group presentations:: This article provides information and suggestions on beneficial habits toward reducing stress that could help someone with symptoms.: This information illustrates the prevalence of mental illness and the need for awareness and early diagnosis. You can post these infographics on community bulletin boards or pass them out during presentations.: To start the conversation on mental health, you can recommend these books in any group or community, then hold a group discussion.: These presentations by someone who has lived with mental illness promote awareness and education. You can schedule a presenter through your local NAMI.: You can post this flyer on bulletin boards at school or church to teach a few statistics about mental illness and the primary warning signs of mental illness.: If your primary audience is teenagers, this toolkit offers resources for speaking about mental health including a discussion guide, a short film featuring a few teens’ personal stories, a presentation guide and additional information and fact sheets to give out.: You can share this prayer in your faith community. Here you will find helpful websites, pamphlets and information about mental health and faith.Last week, an email with the word “hope” in the subject line appeared in my inbox. The note said, “Is there really hope when your son is 23 and refusing help and thinks he is fine but not? I've been seeing a counselor but don't know if it is helping. He gave me the name of NAMI. Just tell me, is there really hope for my son?”That counselor was ready to provide a key to hope—a NAMI brochure. You can do the same. Gather education and awareness tools and share them with a friend, your congregation, work place or school staff. George Washington Carver once said, “Education is the key to unlock the golden door of freedom.” In our case, we are unlocking freedom from ignorance that breeds fear, despair and prejudice. Let’s spread the freedom and hope.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Your Story Can Change Hearts, Minds and Policy",
    "description": "By Emma  Will\r\nTo become an advocate for positive change in your community, all you need is a story. People often believe that to be involved in mental health policy and advocacy work, they must know all the facts and statistics about mental health conditions, or the intricate details of specific bills and legislation. That could not be further from the truth. If you have a story to tell, you can become an advocate.Stories help policymakers understand what it is like to live with a mental health condition, from either your experience or the experience of someone you know or love. A good story can illustrate a complex or abstract policy issue clearly for someone who may be further removed from a topic. It makes the issue personal. Facts and figures can support your advocacy, but your story can move hearts and minds.I see this firsthand in my work at NAMI. I work directly with our advocates from the field: I facilitate grassroots advocacy training sessions, incorporate personal stories in our federal policy work and prepare advocates to meet their policymakers. A member of Congress may not remember numbers and statistics, but a compelling story will stick with them for a long time.At NAMI, when we coach and train advocates, we remind them of three things:While your story is always right, how you tell it matters. We live in a world of sound bites and social media — how will your story break through and catch your policymaker’s attention? Here are some tips to keep in mind as you develop your story.As NAMI members, we know all about advocacy. Many of us have had to be strong advocates for ourselves and our loved ones — at doctors’ offices, hospitals, school, work and sadly, in the criminal justice system. This is what we call personal advocacy: working to improve circumstances for yourself and your loved ones. When we engage in policy advocacy, we are working to improve circumstances for Policy advocacy is about improving the systems that impact people with mental health conditions.When you tell your story for policy advocacy, you will want to connect your lived experience to larger issues in your community. This might be hard to do — policymaking is complicated! Connecting your experience to a broader issue will remind you that you are not alone. Other people in your community have faced similar challenges.So how do you develop a strong personal narrative?If you write two to three sentences for each point, you will walk away with a story that is powerful.We are always collecting stories to power our federal advocacy here at NAMI. For example, we used stories from our advocates to show policymakers and the public the impact of the Affordable Care Act for people with mental health conditions in this  You can share your story with us online .Reach out to your  to learn more about how you can get involved in advocacy in your community. Ask if they offer NAMI Smarts for Advocacy — NAMI’s hands-on, grassroots advocate training program. Through NAMI Smarts you can learn more about how to use your story and work with your policymaker for positive change in your community.\r\n We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Selective Mutism: Frozen in Silence",
    "description": "By Traci  Noelle There are some situations in which I’m literally unable to speak. I’ve been this way for almost my whole life due to an anxiety disorder called . Selective mutism is considered a rare disorder, but the prevalence—which ranges from .03% to 1%—could be an underestimation.I was within the typical range of onset, which is children under five. Most often, symptoms become apparent when a child begins school. Because my family struggled with their own mental health problems, I lived my entire childhood and much of my adulthood undiagnosed. Looking back, I can clearly see the symptoms. As a child, I hid behind my parents’ legs when someone tried to have a conversation with me. In some settings, I could only whisper to someone I felt comfortable with. Everyone thought I was just shy.But selective mutism isn’t shyness.German physician Adolph Kussmaul called it “ in 1877. In 1934, child psychologist Moritz Tramer coined it “elective mutism.”  reflect the notion that professionals considered this form of mutism a  to speak—an oppositional or defiant behavior. The DSM-IV adopted the term “selective mutism” in 1994, reflecting the reality of the disorder as the  to speak.According to the DSM-5, selective mutism is often accompanied by a social anxiety disorder. Separation anxiety disorder, phobias and situational oppositional behaviors are also common. At school, children bullied me for being chubby, and I couldn’t stand up to them. I couldn’t even ask my friends for help, and my silence perhaps implied consent. And because of that experience, I developed PTSD.Left untreated, selective mutism can have a devastating impact on a life. After a series of failed relationships and failed jobs, I had lost hope for a decent life. Angry and embittered, I had a meltdown on social media. After that, I was diagnosed with selective mutism, and a team of caretakers communicated with me via Pinterest. They helped me process my past and emotions using images.Treatment for those living with selective mutism often requires a bit of creativity, like this. It might include any (or all) of the following:If you know anyone who might be living with selective mutism, here are a few tips to communicate with them:Above all, please remember that people living with selective mutism are just like you. Don’t assume they are weird or stupid or unable to comprehend anything just because they can’t verbalize it. We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "May The Skunk Whisperer Be With You",
    "description": "By Nancy  Pizzo BoucherA few months ago, I was invited to speak as part of a NAMI educational session to a new group of about 50 cadets at the Maine Criminal Justice Academy. I talked about our family’s experience in calling 911 for help with a mental health emergency with our son—specifically what helped and what hindered support. I wanted to communicate the critical importance of understanding that aggressive behaviors from those experiencing a mental health emergency are defensive, not offensive. Although aggressive defensive behavior and aggressive offensive behavior may look the same, their source is different, and so is the helpful response that is needed.In situations of mental health distress, defensive behavior often originates in fear of real or perceived danger fueled by depression, anxiety, paranoia or delusions. Offensive behavior is usually planned, predatory and after some particular gain or goal. A successful outcome in responding to a call for help with a mental health emergency requires knowledge about that distinction and training in how best to approach someone in a defensive mode.I began my talk with a true story about my first-born son Ezra’s recent encounter with a skunk—which earned him the nickname of “the skunk whisperer.”My son, his wife and their two boys live in rural Maine. They have one vehicle, which they use to juggle a lot of activities. They home school our grandsons, which involves trips into the city for music jamming sessions, music lessons, language lessons, book clubs at the public library, etc. On this day, my son was heading to a carpentry job. My daughter-in-law, Christina, was driving him to work while the boys were at home minding the dogs and the household. Roads in their area are not backed up with traffic. As Ez and Christina rounded a bend in the road, they saw a skunk crossing in daylight with a glass jar stuck over its head.Ez asked Christina to stop, saying, “I want to try to help him,” and got out of the car. He slowly approached the skunk with his hand outstretched, saying quietly, “I want to try to help you. Let me help you.” He used few words and he used them repetitively. This calm approach worked, and the skunk walked over to him. Trust had been established.At first Ezra tried to pull the jar off the skunk’s head with no luck. He repeated comforting words. The skunk came back toward him. This time Ezra put his hand on the skunk’s back, lifted him and tried to shake the jar off his head. He ended up dropping the skunk, and both Ez and the skunk scuttled back a few feet. The skunk began to raise his tail slowly but then lowered it. He never used his protective weaponry on Ezra!Once more Ez told the skunk that he was there to help. Then he called to Christina to bring him a hammer. He gently hammered at the jar. The jar came off completely. The skunk went on his way, and my son continued on his way to work.Applying lessons from this story could result in better outcomes when police are called to assist with someone who is experiencing a mental health crises. What is needed from responders is what Ez offered to the skunk:If you are calling for help for a loved one, tell the dispatcher clearly that this is a mental health emergency. Request CIT-trained officers or mental health liaison officers as available. Request that they avoid using sirens and lights because the added stimuli can trigger or worsen symptoms and could increase the anxiety, fear or paranoia that your loved one may be experiencing.The job of a police officer is complex. They should be given the training that they need to be ready to respond effectively to calls for help with mental health emergencies.To all those who have chosen to serve and to protect, may the skunk whisperer be with you.Nancy Pizzo Boucher is a dedicated advocate for those dealing with mental illness and works to promote understanding of a person-first approach to healing.

    "title": "Advocating for Veterans’ Mental Health Gave Me a New Purpose in Life",
    "description": "By Tom  Smoot\r\nMany veterans don’t feel understood by people who haven’t served, but I am determined to bridge this gap.My Army career was a whirlwind of near-constant deployments, a suicide attempt and a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). When I left, I connected with fellow veterans through  (WWP) and became aware of the need for more open conversation about invisible wounds.Not only would such conversations encourage more veterans to get the mental health care they deserve but could also help them feel more understood by their neighbors, colleagues and community. My desire to help — and willingness to share my story openly — is how I stumbled onto the path of advocacy.When I joined the military, I gained a sense of identity. I was part of something bigger. I dedicated every waking minute to a higher calling. But when I transitioned out, I felt a void. I was free to be whomever I wanted, but I needed to figure out where to begin.I got involved with WWP and other organizations because I realized my need for a support network of fellow veterans. I found inspiration and comfort among others who understood my struggle. Eventually, I felt ready to admit my truth out loud. That moment changed me.I’ll never forget the reaction when I first shared the story of my suicide attempt. I was at a running event with fellow veterans. At one point in the conversation, I felt comfortable enough to admit to having made a suicide attempt in the past. At first, everyone was silent. No one knew what to say. Even though  estimates we’ve lost nearly four times as many post-9/11 veterans to suicide than combat, it was still incredibly scary to talk about openly.It took weeks for someone in that group to say anything. When a fellow veteran did, it was a message of encouragement; he suggested that I offer my story to more people to help normalize talking about veteran mental health and wellness. He helped me see that my experience may differ from most people’s, but that didn’t mean I was alone.Helping others feel less alone was just the start. Sharing my story became a way to help build more understanding around mental health and the veteran experience, especially since only  of Americans have served in the military.Many veterans I know have started pulling away from the civilian community. I isolated during the early chapters of my PTSD, so I know the feeling. Many of my friends don’t want to deal with the stereotypes or assumptions people might have about veterans. Seeing others minimize their military service due to fear left me wondering, “How do I make this better for even one person?”My willingness to talk openly about my experience evolved into a quest to bridge communication gaps between civilians and my fellow veterans living among them. I focused on my local community in New York City. Being an engineer, I wanted to solve all the problems everyone was facing. Sometimes, I would almost get carried away. I’ve learned that this work requires “putting your oxygen mask on first” before helping others; self-care is part of the advocacy equation.This year, my advocacy reached new heights when Wounded Warrior Project invited me to Washington, DC, to meet with members of Congress as part of Operation Advocacy. I felt back in my element. As an Army Civil Affairs officer, I used to walk villages, helping mediate between the military and the community. Now I was walking the halls of Congress, helping educate policymakers on ways to help those who have served. Without the support of a larger advocacy organization like WWP, people like me would struggle to get in front of policymakers. I’m grateful for how they empower veterans to advocate for each other.Continuing to give a voice to veterans and their needs makes me excited about the future. Thanks to support from my peers, and organizations like WWP, there’s a voice in my head that continues to grow stronger: “Keep going. Keep sharing your story.”It is amazing how much can come from learning to speak up for yourself. You can discover meaning in the pain and challenges of the past. When I first left the military, I wanted to prove I was not broken. I had no idea then that the things I felt ashamed of would become such a public and meaningful part of my purpose.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "How Art Can Help Monitor Bipolar Symptoms",
    "description": "By Taylor  BourassaBeing diagnosed with  may cause some people to feel worthless, hopeless and on edge. They may also experience an increase in stress, anxiety and depression as they go through this significant life change.One way to deal with these feelings is to practice self-care through art, physical activity or relaxation. Self-care can play a large role in monitoring mood changes and symptoms and progressing on the journey of recovery.Art is an incredibly emancipating activity that helps with the release of pent-up emotions and may help someone to better understand these emotions. During manic episodes, art may be both a therapeutic tool and a tool to document certain activities.Art can help people to look back and see how they were feeling, understand what triggered these feelings and determine ways to better monitor these episodes. For instance, with the use of art someone can see that spending time with a certain individual may have spurred a manic episode. This exercise can be done through art journaling, which is documenting the feelings and events that accompany the piece of art.For a depressive episode, art can be used as a visual journal or reference that helps individuals better understand their behaviors and mindsets. By monitoring and visualizing negative behaviors experienced during manic or depressive episodes, people may be more aware of these behaviors and their onset and be better equipped to change these behaviors through behavior training.Noah Hass-Cohan and Richard Carr hypothesize in  that the repeated methods of making art and communicating with others through art could have positive effects similar to cognitive behavioral therapy in changing brain functions. With this knowledge individuals may be able to change their behavior leading up to these episodes. They may avoid certain people, activities and places that place them in a negative situation.The idea that art can help people is based on its expressive nature and its role in emotional and stress release. From a scientific point of view, what happens in the brain when one participates in art may help explain why it is such a therapeutic activity.Cathy Malchiodi claims, in her book,  that art connects the mind and body, which can contribute to feelings of mastery and control. Noah Hass-Cohen and Richard Carr indicate that this helps encourage self-expression and reduce the effects of stressors.An important aspect of monitoring bipolar disorder, as pointed out by Caroline McNamee in , is achieving stable mental states, which art can facilitate. Through artistic expression, one not only achieves a therapeutic release but also an understanding of their mental state, particularly related to an episode of mania or depression, and is better able to monitor and manage behaviors.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "By Patty  DeMauroAs a parent, I’ve learned that it can be unbelievably difficult to recognize that your child is suffering from an illness of any kind, least of all a mental illness. After navigating the maze that is the mental health care system, I discovered that early detection can help reduce the severity of mental illness. This only served to fuel my guilt that I had failed my son.I’ve often wondered: My son Frank had been the “perfect” child. He was happy, fun-loving and intelligent. He was a skier, skateboarder, guitar player and one notch from Eagle Scout. Most importantly, he was the child who sat with the new kid in the lunchroom at school. There was never a doubt in my mind that a bright and happy future awaited him.The changes were gradual. His grades began to slip, then came minor skirmishes with friends, followed by small white lies. He was spending more time alone in his room. Eventually, he refused invitations to do the things he loved. More and more frequently I’d find him staring into space.Deep down, I knew these might be signs warning me of trouble. But when I confronted him, he would turn on a thousand-watt smile and tell me I worried too much. He assured me that he was fine and no different from any other teenager. So I dismissed it all as adolescent angst.For parents, certain milestones in our children’s lives are etched permanently in our minds, usually triumphs and achievements. However, for me, one particularly painful memory endures: The day I received a phone call from the police telling me that my 17-year-old son had been arrested. My first thought was that surely the police had made a mistake. But Frank had been positively identified. He and another boy had broken into a classmate’s home and stolen a CD player.When I arrived at the police station, and they brought Frank to me, I immediately noticed that his face looked different. It was as if strings were pulling on the corners of a smile that was twisted on his face. Rather than question him, I held him tightly and told him he would be fine. Shortly after, he was released to my care until his appointment to appear before a juvenile court judge.Once before the judge, Frankie received a stern lecture. She ordered him to return the stolen property, to perform eight hours of community service a week for the next four months and to submit to weekly drug testing. Frank was respectful and apologetic. He was assigned to a maintenance crew in our town center. Every Wednesday, he went for his drug test. I allowed myself to feel a sense of hope.Then, the phone call came that would change our lives permanently. It was the judge’s office. Frankie had failed the drug test. And this hadn’t been the first time. The judge had spoken to my son and warned him of the consequences of getting high and ignoring her ruling. The judge then sentenced him to the county’s juvenile detention center for six months. He was scheduled to be transported the following day.Frankie remained rigid in his insistence that it was such a “minuscule amount of pot!” He even laughed when I questioned his disregard for the judge’s orders. And then he just shut down. I hugged a wooden statue of my son who gruffly pulled away from me. He said something about his cell phone that I didn’t understand. More signs I was unable to decipher. I wept openly as he walked out the door flanked by a social worker and a county officer.It was during the second month of Frankie’s incarceration that I received a certified letter from the detention center’s medical unit. He had been diagnosed with acute paranoid schizophrenia. He was severely withdrawn, hearing voices and, according to the doctor, completely out of touch with reality. They were prepared to start him on a strict regime of medication for which I had to give my consent.My rational mind fought against my desire to shut down. It was as if I’d been looking at our lives through a different lens. Past events began to make more sense. Schizophrenia began as a fine mist that thickened over time until my son and I were enveloped in an impenetrable fog.I sensed that if I didn’t begin to learn about this disease, my son might remain in his haze of delusion and paranoia. And so began our journey — one that has been, and will continue to be, a lifelong effort.First, I spoke to several psychiatrists referred by our family physician. I read up on anti-psychotic medications and worried about the terrifying side-effects. Along with a psychiatrist who specialized in the treatment of schizophrenia and permission from Frankie’s doctor, I even coordinated the delivery of a more powerful drug to the detention center’s dispensary.I called the charge nurse at the detention center daily to check on my son. She assured me my son was getting the proper care. She also told me that even though Frank was struggling with his symptoms, he always tried to smile and often whispered “thank you” to any nurses that visited. This information made me hopeful that people might look past my son’s diagnosis and see the amazing young man that I knew.Many prayers and small steps later, I had the good fortune of meeting Kathryn Hunter, the then-Executive Director of NAMI Collier County. After meeting Kathryn, I was no longer alone in my search for answers. She stressed the need for embracing every available resource (of which there were many).She suggested my husband and I attend the NAMI Parents Group, a peer-led group that shared the challenges and successes of those facing similar experiences. Most importantly, she introduced us to the Florida Assertive Community Treatment team (FACT), which became an anchor throughout my son’s journey to recovery.FACT, an interdisciplinary approach, offered 24-hour, seven-days-a-week care to people with severe mental illness. She advised us to make FACT our first stop upon our son’s release from the detention center. The orientation to the program gave us a refreshing sense of security, knowing that our son had a psychiatrist, caseworker, therapist and nurse who were only a phone call away.These mentors and resources made all the difference. Frank was able to get on the path to recovery and work toward the life he deserved. Kathryn’s inspiration, and the concern of the many advocates we were privileged to meet along our journey, have kept us committed to share our experiences and spread hope to those also battling this illness.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Schizophrenia and Technology: Opportunities for Recovery ",
    "description": "By Ken  Duckworth, M.D.Technology is rapidly changing the world. People use the Internet at home and on their phones to do everything from gather information to perform everyday tasks. What isn’t well understood is how much people with serious mental illnesses use technology to cope with their symptoms and support their recovery. In a mental health care system with persistent funding cuts and a workforce shortage, technology may be an underappreciated tool. For example, I have had patients living with schizophrenia mark their next appointment in their phones, but my clinic didn’t connect to their phones to provide reminders or notification of changes. How many other missed opportunities are there in this new world?When NAMI received a grant from the Drake Family Trust to study schizophrenia, we chose to investigate the current state of technology use among people with schizophrenia. In 2014, NAMI conducted the Health and Technology Study, the largest study to date to examine ownership and use of technology among individuals living with schizophrenia.NAMI partnered with Harris Poll to prepare an online survey, which an institutional review board approved. The survey questions focused on access to technology, coping strategies and patterns of use. The survey was conducted online from Aug. 25 to Sept. 8, 2014, and included 457 respondents who self-identified as having schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. While the study gives insight about Internet users who self-identify as having schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the study has some limitations. We don’t know how representative this sample is of the larger population, which is an area for further inquiry.The results showed that people living with schizophrenia who responded to the survey use digital technology generally as much as the rest of the population. Respondents used digital technology to help them gather information, improve their capacity to manage symptoms and connect with others.Most respondents (90%) owned more than one digital device such as a personal computer, tablet or smartphone. More than half (54%) had access to smartphones (compared to 64% of all Americans).Many respondents used their devices to manage their mental illness in daily life in the following ways:Respondents used digital devices to connect with others, including supporting other people (26%) and developing relationships with other persons with schizophrenia (26%).The survey findings were published in the in the Digital Technology Use Among Individuals with Schizophrenia: Results from a NAMI Survey” (registration is required to view). The authors were Katrina Gay, National Director of Communications at NAMI, Anand Pandya, M.D., former NAMI Board President, and Ken Duckworth, M.D., Medical Director at NAMI. The authors received help from Dr. John Torus, a leader in technology assessment for the American Psychiatric Association, and Adam Joseph, a Fulbright Scholar who has studied Twitter use and Visit NAMI’s website for  about the study, including a detailed presentation of findings. In addition, presenters from NAMI will discuss the survey at the in Denver, July 6–9. We welcome you to come talk with us about the findings, how you think technology tools can be a resource and how NAMI can use technology to promote recovery.Ken Duckworth is NAMI’s medical director.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Addressing the Increased Risk of Postpartum Depression for Black Women",
    "description": "By Ashley  Kilgoe, BSN, RNI was 27 years old when I found out I was pregnant. Although the pregnancy was unexpected, I was excited. I was even happier when I learned I was having a girl after being an aunt to seven boys. I sang to my daughter, wrote to her daily in a journal and felt overwhelming joy any time she kicked.A few months after I delivered, I started to feel less like myself. I stopped putting effort into my appearance, I lost interest in things I normally enjoyed, and I didn’t even want to be around my own child. I felt guilty and anxious, and I cried frequently. At times, I even found myself wishing she’d “go away.” Back then, I couldn’t name how I felt, but I knew I needed help.Postpartum depression (PPD), also known as perinatal depression, is a mood disorder that occurs during pregnancy or after a recent birth. The condition can create bonding issues between a mother and her baby, contribute to sleep and feeding problems, and cause mental, emotional, developmental and verbal . PPD affects  new mothers, but the risk is  for new mothers of color. Notably, while Black women are more likely to have PPD, they are .There are a number of factors that may contribute to increased rates of PPD among Black women and low levels of treatment, including lifestyle and living conditions.Identifying and understanding these factors may be a lifesaving measure. Ultimately, accessing treatment that includes cultural understanding is critical in improving the health outcomes for expecting Black women and those that have recently given birth.According to the , symptoms of PPD include:While symptoms of postpartum depression have been widely documented, much of the research conducted and screening tools developed have . As a result, doctors may miss  that tend to present in nonwhite women, such as high blood pressure or unexplained body aches, pain and nausea. If a new mother is experiencing these symptoms, it’s important to discuss them with a provider.Black women are  times more likely to have a maternal death than white women in the U.S. Awareness of this risk can heighten stress and anxiety during pregnancy, potentially placing women of color at risk for PPD. Many researchers suggest providers prioritize examining social factors to further understand and address these health disparities. Social factors that can place Black women at increased risk for PPD include:Personally, I was fortunate that my family openly discussed, and even suggested, therapy in my household. However, despite the support from my family, I could not bring myself to tell them I had thoughts of not wanting my daughter. Many Black women experiencing PPD are silenced by shame and stigma. In the Black community, seeking help is often viewed as a sign of weakness. Additionally, when someone makes the decision to seek guidance, they are likely to turn to family, friends or religious leaders rather than trained personnel. In the U.S., when it comes to mental illness, Black individuals are  than nearly all other racial and ethnic groups. Reasons many do not seek professional help can include:One common symptom of PPD is feeling hopeless. If such feelings become severe, a new mother could threaten her life and or die by suicide. It is important that Black mothers receive help as soon as possible to prevent symptoms from escalating.Below is a list of resources to assist women with finding providers and other sources of support.Therapy has been shown to be effective in treating depression and reducing depression symptoms in women with PPD — when mental health providers are culturally sensitive and appropriately trained.Listed below are websites with information on locating providers of color. You can enter your city, state, or zip code and available providers in your area will come up.Connection with local support groups and lactation consultants could be beneficial in curbing rates of PPD. Support groups are great ways to gain insight, link with other mothers and connect with community resources.\r\nMothers can register to join weekly virtual meetings by submitting their names and email addresses. There are four different support groups offered: pregnancy and postpartum, teen mom, Spanish speaking and infant loss.\r\nExpecting and new mothers can go to this site and search the directory for lactation support. Assistance can be provided in person (if local) or electronically (telephone, email and video chat).PPD has been linked with lacking affordable and nutritious food. The Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program provides families with healthy food and nutritional education for mothers and their children. Mothers can contact their local WIC site  or by  to complete an application. Name and birthdates of parent and child is required for application.PPD is a debilitating illness that can produce detrimental outcomes for mothers, families and communities. Education at the provider and community level is essential in combating the disparities in black maternal mental health. Many pediatric physicians observe PPD in mothers at baby wellness visits. Thus, training physicians to do screens that are inclusive of symptoms specific to African American women could help with early detection and treatment of PPD. Equipping providers with culturally appropriate resources can ensure mothers are receiving adequate care. Many women in underserved communities do not seek assistance simply because they are unaware it exists.Ultimately, I turned to  and was able to connect with a therapist that looked like me and understood the cultural factors that specifically impact Black maternal health. Seeking help was one of the best things I could have done. Through therapy, I was able to release the guilt that developed shortly after delivering my daughter.Four years later, I still cry — not due to depression, but because I am in awe of the human I have the honor of raising.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "How My Daughter’s Experience Shaped My Career in Rural Mental Health Care",
    "description": "By Larisa  HammondI knew when I was 16 years old that I would spend my life in some sort of service to others. My mother was the director of the local women’s shelter, a “Back to Work” program for unemployed miners and the local food bank.I was often recruited to volunteer for these different organizations and other community outreach groups. I grew up in the shadow of the Berkely Pit, the largest superfund (toxic) site in the world and witnessed the loss that devastated my community when the price of copper plummeted and mines shut down. I understood early on the complexities of generational poverty, grief and mental health struggles — and how this shared, lived experience shaped all our lives.Naturally, this background informed my interest in community development and health care — but what truly shaped how I work as a provider was my daughter’s struggle to access adequate mental health care in our home state of Montana.Early on in my training, I knew I wanted a career in public health; I was more interested in the prevention of disease than the treatment of preventable diseases. I worked in homeless shelters, prisons, half-way houses and on the streets — bringing health care to people in a way that was accessible without judgment. It was hard work, and I loved it, spending nearly two decades doing this work as a public health nurse.I was at the top of my career, taking on leadership roles and implementing programs for delivering health care to the community, when my life shifted. Everything changed — dramatically and with such force that even now, it is hard to understand — when my 13-year-old daughter started struggling with anorexia and bulimia nervosa. We knew she needed help. Yet, even with all my experience in improving access to care in a rural state, I was suddenly incapable of getting care for my own daughter.At the time, there were only a few nearby therapists who understood the complexities of eating disorders, and there were absolutely no inpatient facilities that provided the medical and psychological support in the entire state of Montana.This meant that for 10 years, my daughter’s necessary inpatient care took place exclusively out of state. Hundreds of thousands of dollars later — and days lost pleading with insurance companies, getting her to appointments, finding tutors, tracking down skilled therapists locally and trying to maintain my career to keep my health insurance — we were all exhausted.Our family was not the only one struggling to find and afford care. At work, I began doing home visits with new mothers and their babies, and I discovered that many of these young women were grappling with untreated psychiatric illnesses and comorbid substance use disorders. Like with my daughter, my responsibility to help my patients find quality psychiatric care felt nearly impossible.Witnessing these unacceptable barriers to and gaps in care inspired me to pursue an advanced degree in nursing, leaning heavily on my public health roots, but with a focus on access to supportive, psychiatric care. I wanted to provide mental health services to patients in need, meeting them in their homes and assessing the environment, culture and family dynamics, all of which drastically impact mental health and well-being.The pandemic has illuminated the mental health crisis in the state of Montana, but it has also created an opportunity to demonstrate the power of telehealth to connect people to quality psychiatric care in their homes. I am now working for Frontier Psychiatry, a company of passionate, dedicated psychiatrists, psychiatric nurse practitioners and family practice practitioners who deliver psychiatric care via telehealth appointments across the entire state.After 10 inpatient hospitalizations and thousands of hours spent in therapy, my daughter Maggie is thriving. She is a fierce advocate for quality psychiatric care for all Montanans and believes in the power of open dialogue and vulnerability.She is a force — and I am a better mother, nurse and human because of her influence. Indeed, it is the brave, innovative people, like my daughter and the founders of Frontier Psychiatry, who make access to quality psychiatric care not just a possibility, but a reality.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "By Rebecca  DukeI recently completed the NAMI  class and found it a valuable learning experience. The course is intended for family members, partners, significant others and friends of individuals living with mental illness. The free educational program helps caregivers better understand and support their loved one through the challenges and struggles of mental illness and learn ways to advocate for treatment and services. In addition, the class stresses the importance of self-care and maintaining one's own well-being while helping a loved one.Topics covered include the following:The class I attended had about 20 students and three teachers/facilitators. We met once a week for 12 sessions. One facilitator, Denise, had been teaching the class for nine years; she shared with me that over time she’s noticed a shift in her students. They now arrive with less anger, more understanding and more knowledge about mental illness. Denise had also noticed an increase in the number of men who were taking the class.The motivation to seek out and participate in the Family-to-Family class remains the same. We join to learn how best to help a loved one and cope with the grief and despair. We discover NAMI because we are desperate for help. We feel exhausted and depleted. We want to assist our loved one, but all our endeavors and attempts seem to fail. As Denise expressed, we are “the walking wounded.”Our first class involved introductions. We shared about ourselves and also about our loved one who lives with mental illness. There were many tear-filled testimonials. Some couldn’t speak about the trials of their situation without crying. As the course continued, we learned about new and factual information, knowledge of various diagnosis, the chemistry involved in brain disorders, communication and problem solving skills and ways to advocate for a loved one.The Family-to-Family class, as with all NAMI programs, regards the lived experience of the caregiver and the individual living with mental illness as invaluable. With each class, as we reviewed the curriculum, participants shared their knowledge, experience and feelings about the various topics.Throughout the 12 sessions, we developed into a network of support, a group of knowing and compassionate people, all of whom get what it’s like to have a loved one who’s living with mental illness. We came to realize that our classmates could support us in a way that no others can: without judgment and with empathy and a greater understanding of our struggles and the weighty responsibility of caring for an individual with a mental illness. I felt less alone.We also received suggestions and encouragement regarding self-care. Our lives can’t only be about our loved one. It’s not just about how to best care for them. It’s also about how to care for ourselves, while trying to do the best for them. Our quality of life matters, and we deserve peace of mind and happiness.Over time, as we became a cohesive group, a transformation took place. The atmosphere and mood became noticeably lighter. With each week, the faces of my classmates, once sullen, drawn and tense, started to relax. At the start of each class, we greeted one another with smiles. Our eyes, once filled with sadness and despair, came back to life. There were still tears, but there was also laughter, healing and hope.The last class was perhaps the most touching and telling. Our facilitators asked us to share our “aha” moments. The moments when something spoke to us. For instance, a piece of information that opened our mind and bettered our understanding, a dialogue that moved us and changed our perception or a tip or technique that had a positive outcome or effect.Here is what the Family-to-Family class participants shared:If you would like more information on this life-changing program, or other free programs from NAMI Valley of the Sun, please contact the Education Coordinator Debbie Martinez at 602-759-8177 or .\r\n We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Aspects of Culturally Competent Care That We Don’t Talk About (But Need To)",
    "description": "By Surabhi  RoyI recall sitting across from my school counselor and feeling somewhat relieved that she came to the United Arab Emirates from the same country as I had, India. How else would she have understood when I said, “My mom doesn’t let me make any decisions...ever,” unless she’d experienced it herself?Looking back, I realize that any counselor, irrespective of nationality, would have understood; teenagers complaining about having no control over their lives is practically universal. However, there are other experiences that aren’t as widely-shared — experiences that are more culturally-specific and connected to identity.Identity is largely informed by internalized values, beliefs and attitudes that we receive from our communities (families, schools, religious institutions, etc.). This self-concept cannot simply be shed when entering a therapy room; it determines how we view ourselves and our external world. Accordingly, our identities impact how we view mental health conditions, treatment and relationships with practitioners.As a result, a positive experience in therapy is dependent on a mental health care practitioner’s cultural competence — their ability to appropriately respond to our unique social, spiritual, economic and political experiences. There are many aspects of culturally competent care, but one, in particular, is often overlooked in our increasingly globalized world: practitioners must be prepared to work with clients from different countries with vastly different cultural practices.When practitioners are not fully equipped to incorporate patients’ complex backgrounds into a session or treatment plan, they risk several adverse outcomes; specifically, the misdiagnosis of clients with non-Western cultural backgrounds and a low percentage of returning clients.According to a 2017 , misdiagnosis can be attributed to practitioners’ understanding of “normal” versus “abnormal” — a concept that is, arguably, culturally specific. For example, a patient entering into a “trance” or “state of possession” is considered normal in some South-Asian cultures; however, a patient in a similar state in a Western context might be diagnosed with schizophrenia.This lack of cultural understanding can also lead to high dropout rates among certain groups. For example, in  addressing effective therapeutic engagement for Hispanic/Latinx people, participants voiced “a general mistrust of a Eurocentric-based mental health settings.”One factor in offering culturally competent care is practitioners’ understanding of the patient-therapist power dynamic. In clinical settings, Western patients tend to view the therapist-client relationship as equal- likely due to their upbringing in an environment valuing autonomy. However, patients from Eastern societies may view the relationship differently. Eastern cultures, , meaning that in a therapeutic setting, a patient would view a practitioner as occupying a “higher” position. This understanding may impact the effectiveness of a therapist’s treatment plan. has demonstrated that techniques, such as Socratic questioning — a method that encourages the patient to take an active role in therapy — is more effective with Western clients. Meanwhile, patients from Eastern societies prefer to follow the guidance and recommendations provided by their therapists. Thus, in order to be more effective when working with non-Western clients, mental health practitioners should consider assuming the role of teacher/leader as opposed to that of a partner.Another intervention technique that therapists use frequently is journaling homework. Journaling one’s thoughts and feelings, a cognitive task, has been proven to be beneficial to Western clients. However, Eastern clients are  with this type of work. Some voiced concerns that the therapist would judge them and their work. Others didn’t benefit from journaling work because the technique  — and research suggests that Eastern clients are more inclined to present with somatic symptoms Thus, a hesitance to journal can be attributed to a limited vocabulary for describing emotional expressions, as often, they would prefer to use somatic metaphors to explain their emotional states.A more helpful way to engage Eastern clients would be providing work that is similar to, or in line with, the client’s cultural values, preferred forms of expression, etc. For example,  found high engagement when Pakistani clients were provided homework that involved working with beads, a cultural form of prayer.The practice of psychotherapy is a dynamic process and is adaptable in nature. While practitioners in the West have shown interest in modifying therapies to better incorporate the backgrounds of patients from other regions, there is still a long way to go.An important first step in developing culturally competent care is conducting more research on people with mental health conditions across cultures and further engaging with existing literature on the subject.On a smaller scale, practitioners must commit to assessing patients’ cultural background in addition to their presenting symptoms and adapting their treatment accordingly.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Athletes and Mental Illness: Major League Baseball Steps Up to the Plate",
    "description": "By Christine  ArmstrongMajor League Baseball (MLB)—America’s national pastime and oldest professional sport—is setting a new standard in the world of sports by recognizing and supporting athletes who contend with mental health conditions.For decades, the stigma surrounding mental illness has discouraged professional athletes and ordinary fans alike from seeking help. Stigma runs especially deep in the professional sports world, where athletes are celebrated for their seemingly superhuman physical talents and unshakeable mental focus.While baseball players historically have been expected to tough out their problems, dust off their mitts and get back out on the field, Pablo S. Torre of Sports Illustrated reports that MLB is paving the way for players to get help and return to the game in his June 2010 article, “A Light in Darkness.”Even as a team sport, baseball is a game that fosters considerable pressure on individual performance. It’s not hard to imagine how an off day for a pitcher or a hitting slump for a fielder can be magnified under the bright lights of a stadium filled with tens of thousands of fans.And then there is all that time on the road, traveling for 81 away games in a season. There’s too much time to reflect on or obsess about shortcomings, and too little time in the company of family and friends who can offer perspective and support. Isolation from these support systems can also engender its own stresses and conflicted emotions. Players on the road may try to suppress feeling of anxiousness or depression, reluctant to confide in a teammate or get help, exacerbating their situation. The stakes are bigger than wins and losses and renewed contracts.Early intervention and treatment are keys for success in managing any illness, including mental health conditions. Players who do not get adequate treatment and support are at risk for failed relationships, broken families, other related health problems and even suicide.During the 2009 season, five players were on the disabled list (DL) for emotional issues, the most in any single MLB season to date; however, many players secretly struggled with mental illness over the years, during a time when baseball executives were likely to either dismiss such issues or ignore them.One exception was Jimmy Piersall, an outfielder with teams including the Boston Red Sox, the Cleveland Indians and the New York Mets during the 1950s and ’60s. In 2008, The Advocate profiled Piersall, who lives with bipolar disorder. The two-time Golden Glove winner and all-star player was perhaps best known by fans for his colorful behavior on the field such as fights with other players and stunts like running around the bases backwards.Piersall had a family history of mental illness, and some of the entertaining antics fans most enjoyed were manifestations of his bipolar disorder. Following electroshock therapy in 1952, he believed his career was over, but instead he received tremendous support from both his teammates and fans. Piersall returned to the Red Sox in 1954 and shared his story with local television and the Saturday Evening Post, a bold move during a time when few spoke about such experiences with extended family or friends, nevermind the American public. He also wrote an autobiography, Fear Strikes Out: The Jim Piersall Story, in 1955, which was made into a movie.While Piersall’s candor challenged stigma, it did not translate into an immediate, marked difference in MLB or public attitudes about mental illness. However, in the decades since, there has been progress.In 1981, the MLB commissioner’s office introduced Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs), which are designed to help employees and their family members manage personal problems that may affect their work performance. Initially, EAPs were largely focused on substance abuse in baseball, but today players can get support and guidance on a broad continuum of issues related to mental health. EAP consultations may involve a medical evaluation or counseling, or other referrals for continued help.Dontrelle Willis, then a pitcher with the Detroit Tigers, was one of the players placed on the disabled list for emotional disorders during the 2009 season, and following his public acknowledgement of an anxiety disorder diagnosis, Torre reported that MLB instituted a new protocol outlining DL criteria for emotional disorders.Each MLB team received a memo outlining DL regulations, specifying that in order for a player to make the DL for an emotional disorder, he “must be evaluated and diagnosed by a qualified mental health professional as suffering from a mental disability that prevents a player from rendering services.”Rather than denying or hiding mental health conditions, players can now take time off to get the help they need, through their team franchise and elsewhere, much as they would in the past for any other physical injury or illness. While relatively few players have stepped forward, the growing number is encouraging and suggests that players are now more comfortable seeking help than in the past.If anyone is the poster child for the merits of mental health treatment and the success of recovery, it may be Zack Greinke of the Kansas City Royals, the reigning American League Cy Young Award Winner.As a senior at Apopka High School in Florida, Gatorade honored him as National High School Player of the Year after he struck out 118 batters and boasted an .55 ERA. Following high school, he transitioned easily to the minor league, finishing the season with a 15-4 record and a 1.93 ERA.As a 20-year-old joining the majors in 2004, Greinke threw a 95 m.p.h. fastball and had enviable control. During that rookie year, he was named Royals pitcher of the year, the youngest player to receive the honor in the history of the team. But the 2005 season was humbling, dramatically different. He finished the season with a 5-17 record and a 5.80 ERA. Greinke’s relationships with his pitching coach and other teammates were strained; he questioned his ability as a pitcher and became more withdrawn.Greinke was so overwhelmed when he returned for the 2006 spring training that he struggled to pitch a single strike in one bullpen session, and again in the following session. He was battling a severe depression, worsened by stresses triggered by his poor performance. It was during this time that he made the decision to walk away from baseball to get a handle on the life and career that were unraveling. At age 22, he missed nearly the entire 2006 season.It was during this break from baseball that Greinke was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, an extreme fear of being scrutinized and judged by others in social or performance situations. Greinke is not alone; approximately 15 million American adults live with social anxiety disorder, but he is unique in that his career involves routinely performing in high-pressure games before tens of thousands of peopleDuring his break from baseball, Greinke had time to learn how to best manage his social anxiety disorder and depression using a combination of medication and therapy. In 2007, he returned to the Royals, stronger and more focused.“I felt really good about it, like things were coming back. Not just to where I pitched last year, but where I pitched a while ago,” Greinke told Sports Illustrated in 2007. “I still have a long way to go. But it was just a good feeling ... that I feel like I know what to do.”Greinke worked his way back to the top of the pack and had a banner year in 2009, winning the American League Cy Young Award and marrying his high school sweatheart, Emily Kuchar, a former Dallas Cowboy cheerleader.Greinke won the American League Cy Young Award in a landslide victory over Felix Hernandez of the Seattle Mariners, earning 25 of the 28 first-place votes. He finished the 2009 season with a 16-8 record and a 2.16 ERA, the lowest in the American league in nearly a decade and a long way back from the 2005 season.Though Greinke doesn’t see himself as a role model for mental illness and treatment, Pablo Torre reported that this spring Greinke remarked, “This medicine is unbelievable. I’m still the same person, but my attitude about everything is different.”The same can be said about Major League Baseball: it is the change in attitude that ultimately will make all the difference in supporting players who can get help, return to baseball and reach their full potential. We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "The Arizona Tragedy: One Year Later ",
    "description": "This week marks a sad anniversary. On January 8, 2011, U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords and 13 other people were gravely wounded—and six persons killed—in a shooting attack in Tucson, Arizona.Charged in the attack was Jared Lee Laughner, 23, who has since been diagnosed with schizophrenia, which had largely gone untreated. His photo appeared in news media across the country reinforcing misconceptions of mental illness and linkage to violence.But something else also happened. In the  of the attack, 50 percent of Americans saw it as the result of failure in the mental care system, not simply mental illness. That recognition fueled a  over cuts in mental health services.The U.S. Surgeon General has  that the likelihood of violence from people with mental illness is low. In fact, “the overall contribution of mental disorders to the total level of violence in society is exceptionally small.”Despite perceptions that result from tragedies like that in Tucson, acts of violence are rare. They are a sign that something has gone terribly wrong, usually in the mental healthcare system.When tragedies involving mental illness occur, it is essential to understand the reality of mental illness—and to find out what is wrong and what is right in the treatment system.In Arizona, the has published an  that has sought to do exactly that. The paper has noted that six months before the tragedy 3,000 seriously mentally ill people in Tucson’s Pima County alone ”lost almost all their services, including access to non-generic medication and caseworker supervision.” Thousands classified as \"generally mentally ill\" also lost funding.“What's the one image [readers] took away from the Tucson shootings?” the paper asked.“We thought so.”“That mug shot of Jared Loughner is haunting. And for the world, it has become the face of mental illness in Arizona. Here, we know that's not true. A picture may be worth a thousand words, but the story of what it's like to be mentally ill in this place cannot be told in a single photograph.”“Tens of thousands of seriously mentally ill people live in Arizona. Some of them look just like you.”The series has included stories about a doctor and a boxing historian who have overcome the worst of mental illness, as well as a man who is homeless but retains a sense of community. The reporters responsible for the series are Paul Rubin and Amy Silverman. Kudos to them! Read the series and if you want to send comments you can via, .Meanwhile, Jared Laughner is in federal prison where because of his illness he is considered incompetent for trial. The prosecution y is fighting to medicate him to improve his condition so that he can be put on trial and—potentially—receive the From a legal perspective, “competence” means that Laughner will need to be able to understand charges against him and assist in his defense  It’s not the same as the legal standard for an insanity defense, which would require that he have known the difference between right and wrong Definitions in the law are not the same as medical definitions.So, this is a sad week of remembrance.Looking beyond the tragedy of six lives lost and 14 others wounded, many serious issues in the case that will still be with us in the coming year—and years ahead.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Book Review: My Age of Anxiety by Scott Stossel",
    "description": "By Kelly  ToddBy Scott StosselKnopf (2013)As editor of , author of multiple books and a happily married family man, some might say Scott Stossel is the picturesque portrayal of happiness in our society. His kind and gentle demeanor even earned him the nickname “human Xanax” around his friends because of the calming nature of his personality. The nickname, as Stossel points out, is almost comically ironic. With his book , Stossel “comes out,” as he puts it, by revealing to the world his actual experience with anxiety which he long sought to hide.Taking on the role of an individual affected by  (as opposed to the finite role of a scholar, psychologist or scientist, he says) Stossel was able to create a unique blend of genres in his book. His book combines the “history, literature, philosophy, religion, popular culture and recent scientific research” of anxiety, sewn together with his own interweaving personal narrative. The stories which he shares with his readers range from heart breaking recollections of his great-grandfather, who was committed to the famous McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass. for acute anxiety, to some seemingly bizarre treatments Stossel has faced on his almost four decade long journey with anxiety, including a failed experience with ipecac to cure him of his phobia of vomiting and lots and lots of vodka.Beginning at the age of 6 and continuing until present day, Stossel has found himself affected by one type of anxiety or another. He has faced panic attacks, phobias, social anxiety, performance anxiety and generalized anxiety, just to name a few. Because of his anxiety, Stossel has tried a variety of treatments including , family and group therapy, hypnosis, meditation and medication. This novel, he writes, is just another way for him to address and (hopefully) come to terms with his anxiety. He explores the history, science and research surrounding his condition in order to shed light for both himself and others on what “anxiety” truly is and what it means to be living with this condition.Stossel’s book could function effectively as a guide to anyone affected by anxiety. His weaving narrative and scholastic descriptions lead the reader on an entertaining and educational journey through the intricacies of anxiety. In his book Stossel first addresses the enigmatic nature of anxiety as a diagnosis. Anxiety only become recognized as a diagnostic category 35 years ago. To this day, the majority of people who diagnose or experience this condition define it differently.Stossel elaborates on the history of anxiety, looking at it from the psychological, social and biological frames of thought. He goes on to write about the effect anxiety has had on his body physically, including vignettes about his nervous stomach and an academic analysis of how anxiety changes ones brain function. His chapter on anxiolytic medication is extremely well researched and is peppered with his own trials and tribulations with medication. Towards the end of the book Stossel reflects on biology once more as he contemplates the nature versus nurture debate, the role genetics may play in anxiety and what this may mean for his children.In the final chapter of his book, Stossel looks once more at what it means to him to experience anxiety. The conclusions he draws could resonate with anyone, whether they experience extreme anxiety or have never experienced it at all. One in five people, he writes, will experience anxiety at some point in their lifetime. With this book as your guide you can come to understand this condition that impacts so many people and one man’s journey toward reconciliation.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "We Got Game: RPG Limit Break Video Game Marathon",
    "description": "By Katrina  GayThink “video gamer” and many will stereotypically assume these are either aimless kids or adult children living out of their parent’s basement, eating potato chips and soda for hours with game consoles in their hands, eyes glued to monitor screens. But did you know 70 percent of America’s households play video games, with the average age of a gamer at 34? And that 40 percent of all gamers are female?If it is true that we develop stereotypes to fill in the blanks when we lack the total picture, then one way of dispelling them is to fill in the information gaps. Ask a true dedicated gamer why they play and they may talk about games as one of the most creative mediums available, or that the community offers so much acceptance along with challenge or that it is a social hobby that brings joy and pleasure.Regardless of the reasons, gamers are a vibrant, active community, comprising nearly 170 million Americans, about the same as baseball fans, and nearly 33 million are console gamers.A specific type of video game, a role-playing game (RPG), is a game in which each participant assumes the role of a character, generally in a fantasy or science fiction setting that can interact within the game's imaginary world.\r\nA speedrun marathon for RPGs of all kinds,  is an upcoming online event in which many RPGs will be completed as quickly as possible in succession. The gamers gather at one venue to speedrun games together, in this case over the course of several days, gaming for more than 100 hours. Spectators can watch the feed of the game, usually along with a live feed of the player and others, including a commentator who is broadcasting the event, live over the Internet through a service such as Twitch. Others can also follow activity via  and via , hashtagging #gamer as well as #HopeStartsWithYou.So what exactly does the upcoming speedrun marathon, RPG Limit Break, have to do with NAMI? Well, the reality is that that many gamers are actually quite attuned to the benefits of giving back to others. In a marathon such as this, viewers will be invited to donate to NAMI and pledge with certain incentives, often integrating into the game as a character or activity to promote interaction.The RPG Limit Break event is hosted in Salt Lake City, Utah, and will be streamed live over the course of several days, starting on May 12, 2 p.m. ET, and scheduled to end the evening of May 16. The event will be broadcasted on their . 100 percent of donations go to NAMI and NAMI Utah. If you want to know what games are being played and when, you can see the full schedule I had the opportunity to talk via email last week to the event host, Brian Cook, online gamer handle Brossentia, about the marathon.  Speedrunning is an activity where people push games to their limit to see how fast a game can be completed. Many speedruns of games push speed to the limit like this  while others break the game apart with glitches like this  (a little language in the video). As a community, hundreds if not thousands of hours go into finding the fastest way to complete a game.\r\n.RPG Limit Break focuses on role-playing games. In general, these games tend to be story-driven, and many can take 30 to 40 hours for someone to finish the game for the first time. Attendees of this event will complete 32 RPGs back-to-back over the course of 5 days. Most will be played by one person, but a few, such as the four-way race with , will involve multiple people.The entire gaming marathon will be streamed 24/7 online at both  and . During that time, viewers are invited to donate towards NAMI; each donation can be put towards an incentive, often something that is either fun or makes the runners' games more difficult.Months before the marathon begins, we open up game submissions. Anyone is allowed to submit a game, a video, and a description of why it would be an exciting game for the marathon. This year, 115 different speedruns were submitted for consideration. Several staff members read through the submissions and watch videos to decide what they feel would work best. Once the game list is created, those who made it into the schedule are invited to run their games in the marathon.Many of the runners are also there volunteering with speedrun commentating, donation processing, manning the tech station, and driving people around the city. We have a special community; even if we don't know someone in person, we often help each other out.I personally tend to speedrun bad video games. That's my niche. I find it fun to show off games that are so bad they're funny. Most of them don't make it into marathons, but I can usually weasel in one or two of these terrible games.Also, my brother-in-law is extremely excited about feeding people at the event. I think we'll all need a diet once this marathon is over.Most online observers will watch a high-quality stream with the game, streamer, and on-site audience in full view. We put a lot of effort into commentary and making sure people watching the speedrun understand what's happening. Throughout the marathon, donation comments will be read, and viewers will have the chance to win prizes when they donate at specific times.For those who haven't seen a marathon before, I highly recommend watching the  speedrun Wednesday afternoon. Tons of people have played this game, but because of extremely broken game physics, the game is completed in under an hour. I'm always baffled by how broken the most beautiful games can be.Throughout the marathon, we have several prizes that we'll give out randomly to those who donate. The Yetee is also having a shirt sale with part of the proceeds going to NAMI. In addition, people can donate to name characters in games, to add challenges, and to sometimes completely choose what route the runner takes in a marathon. For example, with , you can play as three different people, but the runner will only play as the one that wins the bid war.The whole idea of marathons started with a group of gamers called The Speed Gamers; although they weren't as concerned with impressive gameplay, they still made enjoyable streams that contributed to charity. Mike Uyama and others at Speed Demos Archive, one of the first speedrunning sites, decided they wanted to hold a similar charity event that would showcase runners' skill. Because of this, they held the first speedrunning marathon, Classic Games Done Quick. I was not a speedrunner at the time, but my sister ran a game there. They raised just over $10,000 for that first marathon, much more than anyone expected.I became involved with this main group, and the success has been unbelievable. These marathons have become the largest gaming charity events in the world with Awesome Games Done Quick raising more than $1.5 million.A large reason why these speedrunning charity events appeared is because of a desire to give back. Gamers often have a stigma as selfish, greedy and lonely people. The media has repeatedly branded games as a reason that children become violent. However, many gamers become wonderful people and we want to show others how much anyone can change the world.Sure, there is competition, and speedrunning is starting to become a more mainstream kind of activity. Anyone can speedrun a game. In the same way, anyone is invited to participate in these charitable events and give back to the community.Most if not all of us have some connection to mental illness in one way or another. People like to shove mental illness under the rug, but doing that only causes more harm, more pain. I myself struggle with depression, but I've especially struggled with being able to talk about it. I always wanted to be someone who was strong enough to take care of myself. However, that meant going through some of my darkest moments alone. I think true strength is knowing when you need to reach out, and I wish I believed that sooner. NAMI helps people share their experiences and seek help; NAMI helps our culture change and accept others for who they are.NAMI helps us know that it's okay to talk.Our current goal is to raise $30,000 for NAMI. We're always a little afraid of putting a number; we believe any amount of charity is worth the effort, but we also want to keep our expectations high. I think the biggest success will come with the stories and the courage that people take from this. Already, I've had two people send me some stories about their journeys with mental illness. Many moments were heart-wrenching, but they both managed to find a world where they felt accepted. If people leave either with a desire to help or the strength to find help, we will have succeeded.Planning has been intense, but we're at the point where all this work is coming together! I want to thank NAMI for allowing us this chance to work with them. May we all create hope for others.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "How the Mental Health Community Can Support Black Mental Health",
    "description": "By Caitlin C.  ReganOver the past two years, the modern civil rights movement has brought to the forefront a long-overdue racial reckoning in the U.S. The advancing conversation about race in America has been powerful for me as a mental health and substance use counselor.As a white woman, I cannot begin to understand the realities of being a Black person in America, and I recognize the inherent privilege I was born with and have lived with every day since. However, I believe that I — along with other individuals living with mental illness — can empathize with anyone experiencing discrimination and injustice. And I believe I have a responsibility, as a provider, to help dismantle disparities in mental health care and support Black mental health.As a woman living with Bipolar II disorder, a condition that is often misrepresented in media and misunderstood by the general public, I am familiar with some of the realities of discrimination.Many of us who live with mental health conditions know the pain of being unjustly deemed “unstable” or “dangerous” by law enforcement. We are familiar with critical stares. We have missed out on job opportunities or lost hard-earned jobs at the judgment of biased hiring managers and employers. We also experience  of incarceration.Of course, discrimination against people with mental health conditions and discrimination against people of color are not comparable. I have the luxury of “hiding” this part of my identity for my own protection — my mental illness is not (immediately) visible. I do not have to fear for my safety jogging down the street, walking into a store or driving my car.Not only are they not comparable, these two facets of discrimination often compound each other for people of color with mental illness — who are often  group in the mental health care system.So, the question becomes how do we — people living with a mental illness and working in the mental health field — address this inequality and better support Black mental health?As a former teacher, and currently as a clinician, I work almost exclusively with adolescents — often adolescents of color. My job, as I understand it, is to meet my students and clients wherever they are coming from. I offer my support and acknowledge that while I may have a different lived experience, my goal is to empathize and help. Ultimately, it is not their job to learn to trust me. It is my job to earn their respect and trust.Here are a few ways providers can earn their clients’ respect and trust and begin to dismantle the disparities in care for the Black community.\r\nOne step toward becoming a better supporter is acknowledging that we won’t always fully understand another person’s experience. Supporting a movement and validating someone’s experience does not require a personal familiarity with their lived experience. Instead, it requires a willingness to listen, learn and change our behavior accordingly.\r\nMental health care professionals can further support Black mental health by looking into their own practices, acknowledging their biases and altering their care accordingly. Ultimately, every client who walks through the door deserves to be met with empathy and cultural understanding.\r\nIn addition to investigating our own biases, practitioners must educate themselves on health disparities between groups. A 2008  found that white individuals have more access to quality mental health support and professional help — and they are met with more empathy when seeking treatment.\r\nClinicians should consider socioeconomic inequalities when determining practice fees. Adjusted rates could be a step toward presenting better care opportunities for people of color who seek mental health treatment. Some private practices and facilities currently use sliding fee scales, charging clients based on what is doable for their household income rather than a flat rate fee. This is a start and needs to be adopted by all of the mental health world, including hospitalization facilities.\r\nThe mental health care system also needs to keep up with the appropriate language to use in a clinical setting. Clinicians, support groups and anyone engaging in a dialogue about mental health need to consider the inherent trauma that people of color have lived generationally in order to provide unbiased, nonjudgmental support. Using a dated term or unfamiliar language can be incredibly triggering for someone who has experienced severe discrimination and marginalization.\r\nYearly trainings and seminars can help providers better understand cultural triggers. Clinicians, support groups and non-profits need to continually undergo cultural understanding and awareness trainings to stay at the forefront of the discourse and to provide the best, culturally competent care.As a clinician who lives with a mental health disorder, I have taken a personal journey to work toward cultural competence and empathy for all my clients. I do not always get it right — and in those moments, it is critical to recognize my mistakes and work to address it with my client. Often, an apology can go a long way. But this means very little without understanding and measurable growth.In my practice, I continually participate in webinars and trainings for cultural competence, and I devote time to reading on the topic on my own. “Social Justice in Clinical Practice” by Belkin Martinez and Fleck-Henderson has added to my understanding of injustices occurring in the medical space and more broadly, and it has given me a blueprint for how I, as a white clinician, can work to restore social justice in my practice and beyond.Having cultural competence and empathy, to me, does not mean simply addressing the issue in my practice, but speaking up on a larger scale. It is when those of privilege stay silent that injustice prevails. This always plays in my mind in order to work toward change.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

As the quote goes, “Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer.” Every adventure can be a life experience, worth the time, money and even the potential conflicts.When leaving your usual routine and entering new territory, challenges might come up.

    "description": "President Obama submitted his proposed federal budget for 2013 to Congress this week. As expected, it’s controversial. Much of the debate leading into the fall’s elections will be over what programs should be cut and how much taxes should be raised—if at all—on high income Americans in order to reduce the federal government’s deficit, let alone pay down the national debt.As part of the debate, there will be choices important to individuals and families affected by mental illness, regardless of political party. Mental illness does not discriminate. It affects Republicans, Democrats and Independents alike.For example, the President’s proposal  in Medicare and Medicaid payments over 10 years, in part by cutting payments to providers. It also would freeze the National Institutes of Health budget, which is the source for scientific research into mental illness. Along with disability income, housing and other practical needs, these areas make the difference for treatment and recovery.The squeeze on Medicaid especially affects state mental health care systems. In November, 2012, NAMI released a  that outlined the impact of that squeeze, along with state budget cuts.Expect state budget crises to continue. This past week, debate in several states and the impact of cuts—and rising demand—filled headlines in , ,  and . In Florida, posted  of a protest that raised public awareness of the local impact of a proposed $91 million cut in state mental health care.“If I didn’t have this service, I probably would be homeless,” Jeffrey Vassey, a 55-year-old man living with schizophrenia told the paper.Budget debates speak in terms of trillions, billions, millions and thousands of dollars, depending on the size of the community—national, state or local.It’s easy to lose perspective.At the ground level, however, the perspective is easy. Mental health care often makes the difference between living on the streets and moving toward recovery. It can make the difference between life and death.Let’s all keep that fact in mind and remind legislators and political candidates of it every chance we get as the budget debates continue.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "NAMIWalks Makes Mental Illness Awareness a Community Issue ",
    "description": "Since my first involvement in 1988, nearly everyone I have spoken to in NAMI has described their dream of a time when mental illness can be discussed in public as an important issue worthy of public support and understanding. I began to understand the significance of these dreams and soon started dreaming of the same thing myself.From the very beginning of the NAMI movement, part of the challenge was always the need to educate the public about serious mental illness—to let people know that mental illness, like diabetes and heart disease is an illness like any other, that it is indiscriminate in nature, that recovery is possible when the appropriate treatment is available, and that NAMI provides hope for individuals with a serious mental illness, for their families and for their communities.This challenge seemed insurmountable at times. By the beginning of the 21st century, NAMI had built an extensive and powerful national network of advocates and the capacity to begin to initiate the conversations necessary to help people better understand the impact that mental illness has on their community. What was needed was a vehicle that allowed advocates to initiate these conversations on a scale that would begin to make a difference. The NAMIWalk program has provided the perfect opportunity to begin these important conversations.NAMIWalks marks its 10th anniversary in 2012. Since its beginning, NAMIWalks has grown significantly and has become a “community walk for mental illness awareness” and the perfect way to engage every part of the communities that host these events. As each of these walks continues to grow, the opportunities to educate the public and to change the way people see serious mental illness will grow as well. We are approaching the point when these walks stop being so much about ‘walking for NAMI’ and more about ‘communities walking to raise awareness about mental illness.’ As that happens, some of our long held dreams will begin to come true.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "I always hesitate to write about music. It tends to date me. My kids roll their eyes whenever I mention the 1970s, let alone folk rock. In the car, there’s a constant battle over which radio stations or CDs to play.Every now and then, however, there’s a song that resonates and bridges the generational divide. These days, the song is  by the band fun. It strikes a chord somehow with teenage angst and inspires my own kids to rally forward.“Carry On” strikes a chord in me as well, rooted in past battles with depression. Its message is an exhortation, a call to arms and an affirmation of faith. It also has caused me to remember the song that touched me when I was 16 years old—long before I learned that my moodiness was only a hint of worst things to come. Arlo Guthrie sang , which is partly about coming of age in the tumultuous decade between 1961 and 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther songs reflect the same theme. In 2001, Gospel singer Yolanda Adams’   was a call for personal perseverance, but also provided encouragement and hope to a stunned, grief-stricken nation after the terrorist attacks of 9/11.An important distinction is that such songs are inspirational in nature, encouraging listeners to draw on inner strength. They don’t wallow in sadness or pain. I’ve always liked Gilbert O’Sullivan’s  “,” but face it, the fact that in the lyrics, he is on his way to throw himself off a tower doesn’t do much for inspiring a person to hold on.From a biological perspective, music can calm stress and elevate mood by increasing levels of serotonin or dopamine in the brain. Music can literally lift and energize a person’s spirits, helping to overcome anxiety or depression.Tunes and lyrics also stir memories. Music from a pleasurable time and place can therapeutically put people living with depression “back in touch” with important parts of themselves, helping to pull them out of isolation inside their own minds.Thirty years ago, I was struggling with depression, unemployed and disconnected from most of my friends who lived in other cities. Turning points in my recovery came when a close college friends stopped for a night en route from Vermont to Michigan. As we talked into the night, he put one of my records on stereo— by the Beatles—which we had listened to many times together several years before. One song was particularly apt:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that moment I realized that it had been over a year since I had listened to music for music’s sake. It had been part of my withdrawal from the world and suppression of my energy and strength.Turning the music back on helped turn me back on.It doesn’t matter what decade you’re from. Carry on. Don’t ever give up the fight.Share your strength.Tell us the songs that inspire you.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "Last week, I had the opportunity to meet briefly with former first lady Rosalynn Carter in Atlanta after she filmed a public service announcement in support of NAMI Georgia’s  initiative. “Please help … build a circle of support in your community and put self-directed recovery within our reach,” Mrs. Carter asked.Gracious, genuine, committed—as I watched her speak these were some of the words that came to mind. I reflected on this amazing woman and her role in changing our global understanding of mental illness.Mrs. Carter was the first wife of a presidential candidate to declare a campaign promise of her own. Her promise? As first lady, she would assume the responsibility for guiding legislative reform on behalf of the nation’s individuals living with mental illness.Expanding on efforts she initiated as first lady of Georgia, this is exactly what she did after her husband was elected President in 1976. This is remarkable on its own, but to put this in perspective, to say that America’s awareness of mental illness was very much in the dark in the 70s is an understatement; treatment options were in most cases nonexistent and mothers were blamed for their children’s mental illness. To further demonstrate the reality of this era, NAMI was not founded until 1979, three years after Carter’s inauguration.A true pioneer, Mrs. Carter’s compassion and dedication on behalf of individuals and families affected by mental illness has not wavered in the more than 35 years since. Even a partial list of her accomplishments in this arena is eye-opening:Her drive to aid individuals living with mental illness all began during a 1966 encounter early one morning while campaigning for her husband’s bid to become governor of Georgia. Mrs. Carter came upon a stooped and weary woman heading home to care for a daughter with mental illness. She was so moved by her love and dedication that she launched a personal crusade that continues today.From the world stage to a corner of her home state, last week, more than 45 years later, she reminds us that we have a lifetime champion who will embrace all efforts, large and small, in support of improving our lives, our families and our communities.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Enough is Enough: Regulate Restraint and Seclusion in Schools ",
    "description": "The need to regulate restraint and seclusion in our nation’s schools just gained significant momentum with the release of a new report and an NPR  that highlights the need for immediate action. ProPublica  released by the U.S. Department of Education showing that there were 267,000 instances of restraining or secluding children in schools in one school year. The NPR article highlights an incident in which a young boy with autism panicked after being threatened with seclusion. When school officials tried to force him into the “quiet area” a small locked room, bones in his hand were crushed.Despite claims that schools are limiting the use of restraint and seclusion, these unacceptably high numbers suggest otherwise. Some schools reported restraining or secluding students dozens and even hundreds of times each year. In 75 percent of these cases, restraint and seclusion was used with children with a disability including mental illness. Many of these instances of restraint and seclusion were improperly used when an emergency did not exist.Congress has introduced The Keeping All Students Safe Act (, ) to protect children from the unnecessary and harmful use of restraint and seclusion. This legislation allows restraint to be used when a student’s behavior poses an immediate danger of physical harm to that student or anyone else. For example a student may be restrained if they are striking other students, banging their head against the wall, “gouging their eyes”, or other related behaviors. In cases when restraint is used, the bill requires schools to notify the child’s parents and work with them to plan ways to better manage difficult behaviors in the future. The Keeping All Students Safe Act fosters a positive learning environment in schools by promoting interventions that help minimize disruptive classroom behaviors and instructing school staff in more effective ways of addressing students who may be in crisis.Momentum is building for this legislation and we urge you to be a part by  to ask for their support and to use their leadership to move the legislation forward to a vote.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in March 2011. Singing, she believes, has helped her to persevere.“I want to show people that  doesn’t define who you are,” she said. In doing so, she has struck a powerful blow against stigma and discrimination.NAMI members cheered and applauded in their living rooms. For those who were watching with their parents or teenage children, it was an emotional moment.The moment carried even greater emotion as Shelby sang “Temporary Home” by Carrie Underwood. The refrain can serve as a metaphor in the journey toward recovery:Both the video and vocal performance can be seen on many websites, including Talking publicly about your mental illness not only can help strike a blow against stigma, it can be part of recovery itself. It can liberate a person from feelings of stigma. It can stop a person from internalizing shame or fear. Besides being a step toward recovery taken for herself, Shelby’s audition serves as an example that can inspire others. That’s one of the principles on which NAMI’s public education program  also rests.So what happens next?The audition judges selected Shelby to compete as a semi-finalist in Hollywood. Contestants will be eliminated until a winner is selected by the audience in the final episode in May.I think NAMI members will know who they want to vote for.Keep singing, Shelby.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "NAMI recently engaged in a dialogue with National Public Radio () over language, stigma and mental illness. It in turn led to discussion of what is meant by “political correctness.”It started with NPR’s coverage of a pending  in which a man is appealing a conviction for falsely claiming to have received the Congressional Medal of Honor. In an interview with the man’s lawyer, NPR reporter  asked whether his client, a habitual liar, was a “nutcase.”NPR received many complaints. In consultation with NAMI, the NPR Ombudsman column on its website   about language, stigma and mental illness.NAMI pointed them to the  on Mental Health, which frames stigma as a public health issue. We also acknowledged that assessing stigma can involve “balancing” several considerations. Particularly in entertainment media, NAMI’s “red flags” of stigma include:In the case of the NPR interview, “nutcase” waved at least three red flags. First, the context: it was used to describe a person (Description of a legal argument as “nutty” for example would not have been as great a concern).” Second, the word is often used to describe people disparagingly—with at least a suggestion that they live with mental illness. Finally, the word has an almost cartoonish impact that tends to trivialize mental illness, devaluing it as a social concern.One of the best strategies in fighting stigma is to turn protest into dialogue. Dialogue does not necessarily lead to agreement, but it does heighten awareness and potentially connect to broader social concerns.That’s exactly what happened in this case.One NPR listener complained: “I’m sick to death of political correctness rules ... we use words like 'nutcase,' there's no reason to avoid them.\"NPR’s Ombudsman replied: “Political correctness can surely get out of hand, but stop and think for a minute: It is highly likely that you or a family member or friend has at some point had some kind of mental illness.“We often stigmatize it in ways that we no longer do with physical ailments, or race, or any of a number of human conditions. Calling someone a \"nutcase\" for something they can't help and others may share is out of bounds.”The mention of “political correctness” led to  in the next NPR Ombudsman column.And then a One can empathize with people who sometimes feel that there’s too much “political correctness” today. But what does the phrase actually mean? Shouldn't we always try to do the right thing? Shouldn’t there be civic dialogue about language and attitudes? In many respects, invoking political correctness is only a way to duck an issue, rather than consider it.What do you think? What do you consider most stigmatizing? Language, stereotypes, offensive symbols or something else?Does the mental health community’s concern about stigma ever reach a point of too much political correctness?We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

The first season, which premiered in 2011, follows Carrie’s efforts to uncover a U.S. Marine who is thought to have been turned while trying to target an Al-Qaeda kingpin while she struggles with (and hides) her mental illness from everyone but her sister.The juxtaposition between Carrie’s determination to do her job well and sacrifice everything—including her own mental health—while unraveling a mystery reels the viewer in.

She's so capable in so many ways and in others she's so ultimately unreliable.”As Carrie’s authority is undermined by the discovery of her illness by coworkers, her mania also serves as a useful tool and helps her begin to solve the case.

In the end, Carrie’s bipolar depression is so severe and unresponsive that she elects to undergo … just as she remembers a key element to the plot.What’s crucial about this television series is its realistic portrayal of mental illness as well as real life—how in a matter of days mental illness can turn a life upside down, how peers, loved ones and coworkers can turn on you. How you start to doubt your own reality, and even how people can manipulate that reality. What’s really key, though, is that Carrie as a person, her work and her passion come first: Her mental illness is simply another hurdle she must overcome. Her illness is seen on the same playing field as countless other hurdles in her life, from political schemers to master plots of terrorism and deception to a strained family life.\"Playing someone with bipolar and taking the mystery out of that is a responsibility I don't take lightly,\" Danes said. “I really spent a lot of time doing my research to make it a specific portrayal and not just a generalized portrait of ‘being crazy.’ I didn't want to play crazy—that’s not bipolar disorder.\"We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "While making  a documentary about the impact of my father’s mental illness on our relationship, I became interested in global mental health. I soon learned that it is the most ignored of all health areas.In truth, global mental health is the most global of all health areas. Think about it: many illnesses like malaria only affect certain parts of the globe.I started to film mental health stories outside the United States, interviewing leaders and advocates. This summer, a new website, Take5Now.com, will be launched where these stories and other resources will be brought to life. It is intended to foster interactive dialogue about mental health from a global perspective.To stay informed about theexact launch date for Take5Now.com, please join You can also view a five-minute film, , right now on YouTube. The film was shot in South Africa about a woman, Buyiswa, living with . When Buyiswa started hearing voices in her twenties her mother took her to a traditional healer who gave her herbs. Nothing improved.Spending time in South Africa I learned how traditional and religious healers are indeed where many Africans go for mental health care. This is the same throughout Africa, India and in many other countries.Most developing countries spend less than one percent of their health budgets on mental health and eight out of 10 people with severe mental illness go untreated. Educational campaigns that link mental illness to a bio-medical paradigm are practically nonexistent. Consequently, in many low income countries the age-old explanations of demon possession and spells cast by jealous neighbors persist.Filming globally for my other upcoming film on global mental health, people shared with me instances of being physically abused, from hair pulling to beating, by traditional healers. I questioned these stories at first because they sounded too cliché, but as I heard more of them, I was forced to accept the sad truth of their reality.While there can be harm caused by traditional healers, whether through physical abuse or ineffectiveness, to advocate for doing away with them would nonetheless be counter-productive. The healers are an integral part of a community and often bring comfort and understanding to many individuals and their families.For  I interviewed a traditional healer and watched many of her clients chat with her and collect herbs and pieces of fur. I could feel the strong rapport she had with them.I have been excited to learn about programs that train traditional healers about serious mental health. Trainings focus on which individuals could benefit from Westernized approaches to mental health treatment. The good news is that many healers welcome the training. They are grateful for being recognized and respected by the larger health establishment. Meanwhile it is reassuring to know that many developing countries are finally realizing the burden that mental illness imposes on its citizens. They have begun to dedicate more resources toward services and treatments. Studies show that psychological and pharmacological interventions are cost-effective in developing countries. In fact, they are just as cost-effective as antiretroviral treatment for . As evidence-based interventions increase, the sole reliance on traditional healers in many parts of the world will diminish.The challenge is to empower all players in all communities to have the knowledge and resources to help end suffering and to foster connections between us.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

My stunned reaction and the look of confusion on my face prompted the doctor to ask, “Do you know what psychotic means?”Yes, I knew the meaning of the word psychotic, but I could not imagine it describing my son. I knew him as wildly imaginative, dark and moody, prone to violent temper tantrums, unrealistically fearful and overly attached to me, but psychotic? No way. The doctor went on to explain his clinical findings and advised a complete neurological evaluation to rule out possible medical explanations. If no neurological issues were identified, I was advised to contact a psychiatrist so that my son could begin taking anti-psychotic medications, as soon as possible. That was quite an afternoon; it marked the end of our “normal” life, and the beginning of a journey my son, Matthew, and I are still traveling.After the initial shock of hearing the diagnosis of  my first reaction was denial. The doctor must be wrong. Then as reality began to come into focus, I experienced the full range of emotions most often associated with grief including: anger, depression and a sense of loss. Finally, I came to an acceptance of my son’s mental illness and began learning all that I could about the disease, treatments, resources and support networks. I became determined to become an effective advocate for my child.As a parent of someone with , I realized what an important role I played in my son’s wellbeing. If you love someone with a mental illness, you too may be the only person standing in the gap between them and homelessness, jail, abuse or suicide. At times, you may need to be their voice when they cannot speak for themselves or no one listens. Or, you may need to do the leg work involved in locating mental health services and building a support network. At others, you may need to make tough, difficult decisions that break your heart; but, if not you, who?Being proactive in your advocacy is the best course of action. Hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst. Contact your  or State Organization for information, support groups and referrals to local services. Line up a trusted group of professionals: a psychiatrist, therapist, and social worker/case manager. Become familiar with your community mental health center or clinics. Apply for disability assistance, either Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Income () which will make it possible to access  or . Learn about supported housing and employment options. There is help available, but resources are limited. Being patient, but persistent with mental health professionals and service providers gets the best results. However, it you believe your loved one is being abused, falsely accused, or discriminated against a lawyer may need to represent their rights.  Overtime, Matthew and I have needed to rely on all these resources.It has been twenty years since Matthew and I began this journey. He is living with schizophrenia, and I am his mom. Schizophrenia has affected every aspect of his life, but it does not define him. Have courage, there is hope.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

Absence of final regulations has created confusion and uncertainty for both employers and people who live with mental illness.Many health care plans still don’t provide mental health coverage. Others impose barriers that do not exist for other conditions. Families in crisis often discover abruptly that their health insurance plans don’t cover the help they need.In an online comment posted to Domenici’s and Smith’s article in the , a man observed: “If I hadn't had a good health insurance policy that covered mental health issues, I wouldn't have gotten help two years ago, and I'd probably be dead right now.”One woman wroteI have watched my parents struggle to access mental health and substance abuse treatment for my brother, paying thousands of dollars out of pocket for his care. Access to effective, evidence-based treatments should not be limited to those with the means to pay.”Another woman recognized “how integral mental health is to overall health. We know that there is a clear relationship between diseases such as heart disease and diabetes and depression. And the reality is that while mental health conditions are common, they are treatable. The mental health parity law ensures that people receive services and get help.”What can you do?Contact the HHS Public Affairs Office: Contact the White House:  asking the President to issue final regulations for the mental health parity bill.

    "title": "When Stigma Struck Out: The Jimmy Piersall Story",
    "description": "By Bob  CarollaJimmy Piersall was one of the greatest outfielders of the 1950s and 60s. He played 17 seasons, most notably with the BostonRed Sox, the Cleveland Indians, and the New York Mets. He won two Golden Glove awards and twice was selected for major league baseball’s All-Star Team.Still, he has said: “Probably the best thing that ever happened to me was going nuts. Whoever heard of Jimmy Piersall until that happened?”His mental illness—specifically bipolar disorder—played out publicly at a time when mental illness usually was kept hidden. Piersall was born in 1929. Growing up, he was popular, but “high-strung” and a “worrier,” who suffered severe headaches. His mother lived with depression and was hospitalized many times.He had a temper—and an insecurity that could turn to paranoia. In 1952, the Red Sox promoted Piersall from their farm team, the Birmingham Barons, but he learned that the team intended to play him\r\nat shortstop. In his memoir, Fear Strikes Out, Piersall recalls thinking: “It’s impossible. I’m not a shortstop. I’m a center fielder. [The shift] might ruin me. Wait a minute. I’ll bet that’s just what they want to do.” Fear of failure came at a time when he had been married only a few years, with two young children, and was providing full financial support for his parents.Flashes of temper early in the season turned into a violent brawl with Yankee Billy Martin on May 24, 1952. Later in the game, he fought with one of his own teammates, and then broke down crying after he was benched.Even after he was shifted to the outfield, Piersall’s behavior grew increasingly bizarre—which, ironically, endeared him to fans, who enjoyed the spectacle. He spread his arms like an airplane while running bases and mimicked the mannerisms of other players. In a game with the St. Louis Browns on June 11, he taunted pitcher Satchel Paige, calling out “oink, oink, oink” from first base.“That boy is sick,” said Paige, one of the few people who recognized what was happening.On June 20, the Red Sox sent Piersall back to Birmingham in the hope it would “straighten him out.” Instead, he was thrown out of four games and suspended. On July 20, newspapers reported he would “take a rest” on the advice of his physician.Two weeks later, Piersall woke up in restraints at Westborough State Hospital in Massachusetts. He had received electroshock therapy and did not remember much of the previous year. His teammates visited him in the hospital. He received hundreds of letters from fans. He thought his career was over, but the Red Sox brought him back for the 1953 season. In 1954, Piersall told his story on a local television show in Chicago, leading to an outpouring of support. He expanded his disclosure in a two-part story in the Saturday Evening Post, entitled “They Called Me Crazy—and I Was,” which led to the publication of Fear Strikes Out in 1955. Two years later, the book was made into a movie with the same title, starring Anthony Perkins and Karl Malden. “Mental illness is no different from any kind of illness,” observed Piersall’s doctor in the film. The magazine series, book, and movie delivered a powerful anti-stigma message on a national scale.Piersall adopted an attitude of laughing at his illness. He cultivated a persona based on “zany antics.”In 1959, Piersall was traded to the Cleveland Indians. Once, he pulled out a water pistol and squirted an umpire. Another time, his teammates had to rescue him after he challenged Yankee fans to a fight. He didn’t hesitate to confront hecklers who made mean-spirited slurs about mental illness.In 1963, Piersall hit his 100th home run while playing for the New York Mets. He celebrated by running the bases facing backwards. Soon after, Mets manager Casey Stengel, a colorful personality in his own right, announced he was letting Piersall go because “there was room for only one clown on the team.”Piersall finished his playing career in 1967 with the Los Angeles Angels. He became outfield instructor for the Texas Rangers and a broadcaster for the Chicago White Sox.After being fired for feuding with the White Sox management, he wrote a second memoir The Truth Hurts (1985)—in which he provided additional detail about his illness.Some might argue that Piersall perpetuated stigma through outrageous behavior and embrace of language like “crazy.” But that is perhaps too easy to say in 2008. Fifty years ago, going public with mental illness was like breaking the sound barrier. The sonic boom has echoed through the years.In 2009, Piersall will turn 80. He hasn’t made baseball’s Hall of Fame, but his name is included on NAMI’s “Famous People” poster, which honors individuals whose mental illnesses have enriched our lives.This article is based on Piersall’s autobiography, , and reporting by Dom Amore; “Quite The Character,” Hartford Courant (APSE Writing Competition 1999); Bob Dolgan, “One of a Kind,” Baseball Digest (December 1, 2001); Mike Puma, “A Hall of Fame Personality,” ESPN.com (May 24, 2004); and Jeff Merron, “Mystery Man,” 108 Magazine (Summer 2007).

    "title": "Having an Impact: Reporter Meg Kissinger and Her Brother Jake ",
    "description": "The  presented its top award this past weekend to the for a series published earlier this year, titled “Imminent Danger.”The series probed the issue of involuntary commitment for mental illness, based on the legal standard of “imminent danger to oneself or others.”Only one percent of people with severe mental illness can be considered “dangerous,” the newspaper reported, while noting also that a punch or a shove was included in the definition relative to other forms of violence.  resulted in strong reactions in the mental health community (pro and con). Discussion of violence (and the title) risked perpetuating stigma around mental illness while involuntary treatment is an issue that often splits mental health advocates.As part of the series, the published an editorial,  which highlighted measures ranging from advanced directives to mental health courts. Overall, the project reflects the newspaper’s long-standing commitment to mental health issues.Meg Kissinger is the reporter at the center of that mission. She is also one of only a few\r\n who have a sustained interest in the mental health care system. It is partly rooted in her family background.Earlier this month, she published  about her brother Jake’s experience living with mental illness titled “Can Adult Siblings Connect When Mental illness is in the Mix?” When Jake was 4 years old, he saved Meg’s life by running for help after she fell into a lake and almost drowned.“Jake's real name is John Matthew, after my dad's older brother who was killed during World War II. This gave Jake a distinction as the white buffalo of our family, the rare and revered one who seemed to float above the fray,” Meg wrote.A motivated and vivacious teen, Jake was an Eagle Scout. However, Jake ultimately dropped out of college. He now lives in a group home near Chicago, but is considering a move back to Milwaukee.Jake was the third of eight children in the family. Meg was the fourth.Meg became a reporter in part because of  her unique vantage point as the fourth child. She was always curious. Within the family, she was the one who often could report to members of the family what other members were doing. (Her status as a middle child may also be responsible for the “balanced” perspective that marks much of her work).Meg’s first story about mental illness in the  was a reminiscence in 1986 about the suicide of her sister, Nancy, eight years before. The second was in 1998, after her brother, Danny, also died from suicide.Reluctant at first, she wrote the second story “because it was important”—as much as any about heart disease or diabetes that often are published.Those stories “galvanized” Meg’s professional direction. Her managing editor, George Stanley, has encouraged that direction allowing her to continuing filing in-depth special reports, including  in 2010.At one point, Meg was inspired by the contrast between her brother Jake’s living conditions and those of other people living with mental illness in Milwaukee. Her reporting sparked local action to increase housing for people with mental illness by about 500 units.She takes the greatest pride in stories that having an impact.After reporting on so many parts of a broken mental health care system, Meg hopes to focus next on programs that work. But, it also will mean comparing them to programs that don’t.Meanwhile, Meg’s story of her relationship with her brother Jake is . It certainly moved me.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog! We feature the latest research, stories of recovery, ways to end stigma and strategies for living well with mental illness.
