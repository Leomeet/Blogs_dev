    "title": "Book Review:",
    "description": "By Kelly  ToddBy Scott StosselKnopf (2013)As editor of , author of multiple books and a happily married family man, some might say Scott Stossel is the picturesque portrayal of happiness in our society. His kind and gentle demeanor even earned him the nickname “human Xanax” around his friends because of the calming nature of his personality. The nickname, as Stossel points out, is almost comically ironic. With his book , Stossel “comes out,” as he puts it, by revealing to the world his actual experience with anxiety which he long sought to hide.Taking on the role of an individual affected by  (as opposed to the finite role of a scholar, psychologist or scientist, he says) Stossel was able to create a unique blend of genres in his book. His book combines the “history, literature, philosophy, religion, popular culture and recent scientific research” of anxiety, sewn together with his own interweaving personal narrative. The stories which he shares with his readers range from heart breaking recollections of his great-grandfather, who was committed to the famous McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass. for acute anxiety, to some seemingly bizarre treatments Stossel has faced on his almost four decade long journey with anxiety, including a failed experience with ipecac to cure him of his phobia of vomiting and lots and lots of vodka.Beginning at the age of 6 and continuing until present day, Stossel has found himself affected by one type of anxiety or another. He has faced panic attacks, phobias, social anxiety, performance anxiety and generalized anxiety, just to name a few. Because of his anxiety, Stossel has tried a variety of treatments including , family and group therapy, hypnosis, meditation and medication. This novel, he writes, is just another way for him to address and (hopefully) come to terms with his anxiety. He explores the history, science and research surrounding his condition in order to shed light for both himself and others on what “anxiety” truly is and what it means to be living with this condition.Stossel’s book could function effectively as a guide to anyone affected by anxiety. His weaving narrative and scholastic descriptions lead the reader on an entertaining and educational journey through the intricacies of anxiety. In his book Stossel first addresses the enigmatic nature of anxiety as a diagnosis. Anxiety only become recognized as a diagnostic category 35 years ago. To this day, the majority of people who diagnose or experience this condition define it differently.Stossel elaborates on the history of anxiety, looking at it from the psychological, social and biological frames of thought. He goes on to write about the effect anxiety has had on his body physically, including vignettes about his nervous stomach and an academic analysis of how anxiety changes ones brain function. His chapter on anxiolytic medication is extremely well researched and is peppered with his own trials and tribulations with medication. Towards the end of the book Stossel reflects on biology once more as he contemplates the nature versus nurture debate, the role genetics may play in anxiety and what this may mean for his children.In the final chapter of his book, Stossel looks once more at what it means to him to experience anxiety. The conclusions he draws could resonate with anyone, whether they experience extreme anxiety or have never experienced it at all. One in five people, he writes, will experience anxiety at some point in their lifetime. With this book as your guide you can come to understand this condition that impacts so many people and one man’s journey toward reconciliation.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "We Got Game: RPG Limit Break Video Game Marathon",
    "description": "By Katrina  GayThink “video gamer” and many will stereotypically assume these are either aimless kids or adult children living out of their parent’s basement, eating potato chips and soda for hours with game consoles in their hands, eyes glued to monitor screens. But did you know 70 percent of America’s households play video games, with the average age of a gamer at 34? And that 40 percent of all gamers are female?If it is true that we develop stereotypes to fill in the blanks when we lack the total picture, then one way of dispelling them is to fill in the information gaps. Ask a true dedicated gamer why they play and they may talk about games as one of the most creative mediums available, or that the community offers so much acceptance along with challenge or that it is a social hobby that brings joy and pleasure.Regardless of the reasons, gamers are a vibrant, active community, comprising nearly 170 million Americans, about the same as baseball fans, and nearly 33 million are console gamers.A specific type of video game, a role-playing game (RPG), is a game in which each participant assumes the role of a character, generally in a fantasy or science fiction setting that can interact within the game's imaginary world.\r\nA speedrun marathon for RPGs of all kinds,  is an upcoming online event in which many RPGs will be completed as quickly as possible in succession. The gamers gather at one venue to speedrun games together, in this case over the course of several days, gaming for more than 100 hours. Spectators can watch the feed of the game, usually along with a live feed of the player and others, including a commentator who is broadcasting the event, live over the Internet through a service such as Twitch. Others can also follow activity via  and via , hashtagging #gamer as well as #HopeStartsWithYou.So what exactly does the upcoming speedrun marathon, RPG Limit Break, have to do with NAMI? Well, the reality is that that many gamers are actually quite attuned to the benefits of giving back to others. In a marathon such as this, viewers will be invited to donate to NAMI and pledge with certain incentives, often integrating into the game as a character or activity to promote interaction.The RPG Limit Break event is hosted in Salt Lake City, Utah, and will be streamed live over the course of several days, starting on May 12, 2 p.m. ET, and scheduled to end the evening of May 16. The event will be broadcasted on their . 100 percent of donations go to NAMI and NAMI Utah. If you want to know what games are being played and when, you can see the full schedule I had the opportunity to talk via email last week to the event host, Brian Cook, online gamer handle Brossentia, about the marathon.  Speedrunning is an activity where people push games to their limit to see how fast a game can be completed. Many speedruns of games push speed to the limit like this  while others break the game apart with glitches like this  (a little language in the video). As a community, hundreds if not thousands of hours go into finding the fastest way to complete a game.\r\n.RPG Limit Break focuses on role-playing games. In general, these games tend to be story-driven, and many can take 30 to 40 hours for someone to finish the game for the first time. Attendees of this event will complete 32 RPGs back-to-back over the course of 5 days. Most will be played by one person, but a few, such as the four-way race with , will involve multiple people.The entire gaming marathon will be streamed 24/7 online at both  and . During that time, viewers are invited to donate towards NAMI; each donation can be put towards an incentive, often something that is either fun or makes the runners' games more difficult.Months before the marathon begins, we open up game submissions. Anyone is allowed to submit a game, a video, and a description of why it would be an exciting game for the marathon. This year, 115 different speedruns were submitted for consideration. Several staff members read through the submissions and watch videos to decide what they feel would work best. Once the game list is created, those who made it into the schedule are invited to run their games in the marathon.Many of the runners are also there volunteering with speedrun commentating, donation processing, manning the tech station, and driving people around the city. We have a special community; even if we don't know someone in person, we often help each other out.I personally tend to speedrun bad video games. That's my niche. I find it fun to show off games that are so bad they're funny. Most of them don't make it into marathons, but I can usually weasel in one or two of these terrible games.Also, my brother-in-law is extremely excited about feeding people at the event. I think we'll all need a diet once this marathon is over.Most online observers will watch a high-quality stream with the game, streamer, and on-site audience in full view. We put a lot of effort into commentary and making sure people watching the speedrun understand what's happening. Throughout the marathon, donation comments will be read, and viewers will have the chance to win prizes when they donate at specific times.For those who haven't seen a marathon before, I highly recommend watching the  speedrun Wednesday afternoon. Tons of people have played this game, but because of extremely broken game physics, the game is completed in under an hour. I'm always baffled by how broken the most beautiful games can be.Throughout the marathon, we have several prizes that we'll give out randomly to those who donate. The Yetee is also having a shirt sale with part of the proceeds going to NAMI. In addition, people can donate to name characters in games, to add challenges, and to sometimes completely choose what route the runner takes in a marathon. For example, with , you can play as three different people, but the runner will only play as the one that wins the bid war.The whole idea of marathons started with a group of gamers called The Speed Gamers; although they weren't as concerned with impressive gameplay, they still made enjoyable streams that contributed to charity. Mike Uyama and others at Speed Demos Archive, one of the first speedrunning sites, decided they wanted to hold a similar charity event that would showcase runners' skill. Because of this, they held the first speedrunning marathon, Classic Games Done Quick. I was not a speedrunner at the time, but my sister ran a game there. They raised just over $10,000 for that first marathon, much more than anyone expected.I became involved with this main group, and the success has been unbelievable. These marathons have become the largest gaming charity events in the world with Awesome Games Done Quick raising more than $1.5 million.A large reason why these speedrunning charity events appeared is because of a desire to give back. Gamers often have a stigma as selfish, greedy and lonely people. The media has repeatedly branded games as a reason that children become violent. However, many gamers become wonderful people and we want to show others how much anyone can change the world.Sure, there is competition, and speedrunning is starting to become a more mainstream kind of activity. Anyone can speedrun a game. In the same way, anyone is invited to participate in these charitable events and give back to the community.Most if not all of us have some connection to mental illness in one way or another. People like to shove mental illness under the rug, but doing that only causes more harm, more pain. I myself struggle with depression, but I've especially struggled with being able to talk about it. I always wanted to be someone who was strong enough to take care of myself. However, that meant going through some of my darkest moments alone. I think true strength is knowing when you need to reach out, and I wish I believed that sooner. NAMI helps people share their experiences and seek help; NAMI helps our culture change and accept others for who they are.NAMI helps us know that it's okay to talk.Our current goal is to raise $30,000 for NAMI. We're always a little afraid of putting a number; we believe any amount of charity is worth the effort, but we also want to keep our expectations high. I think the biggest success will come with the stories and the courage that people take from this. Already, I've had two people send me some stories about their journeys with mental illness. Many moments were heart-wrenching, but they both managed to find a world where they felt accepted. If people leave either with a desire to help or the strength to find help, we will have succeeded.Planning has been intense, but we're at the point where all this work is coming together! I want to thank NAMI for allowing us this chance to work with them. May we all create hope for others.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "How the Mental Health Community Can Support Black Mental Health",
    "description": "By Caitlin C.  ReganOver the past two years, the modern civil rights movement has brought to the forefront a long-overdue racial reckoning in the U.S. The advancing conversation about race in America has been powerful for me as a mental health and substance use counselor.As a white woman, I cannot begin to understand the realities of being a Black person in America, and I recognize the inherent privilege I was born with and have lived with every day since. However, I believe that I — along with other individuals living with mental illness — can empathize with anyone experiencing discrimination and injustice. And I believe I have a responsibility, as a provider, to help dismantle disparities in mental health care and support Black mental health.As a woman living with Bipolar II disorder, a condition that is often misrepresented in media and misunderstood by the general public, I am familiar with some of the realities of discrimination.Many of us who live with mental health conditions know the pain of being unjustly deemed “unstable” or “dangerous” by law enforcement. We are familiar with critical stares. We have missed out on job opportunities or lost hard-earned jobs at the judgment of biased hiring managers and employers. We also experience  of incarceration.Of course, discrimination against people with mental health conditions and discrimination against people of color are not comparable. I have the luxury of “hiding” this part of my identity for my own protection — my mental illness is not (immediately) visible. I do not have to fear for my safety jogging down the street, walking into a store or driving my car.Not only are they not comparable, these two facets of discrimination often compound each other for people of color with mental illness — who are often  group in the mental health care system.So, the question becomes how do we — people living with a mental illness and working in the mental health field — address this inequality and better support Black mental health?As a former teacher, and currently as a clinician, I work almost exclusively with adolescents — often adolescents of color. My job, as I understand it, is to meet my students and clients wherever they are coming from. I offer my support and acknowledge that while I may have a different lived experience, my goal is to empathize and help. Ultimately, it is not their job to learn to trust me. It is my job to earn their respect and trust.Here are a few ways providers can earn their clients’ respect and trust and begin to dismantle the disparities in care for the Black community.\r\nOne step toward becoming a better supporter is acknowledging that we won’t always fully understand another person’s experience. Supporting a movement and validating someone’s experience does not require a personal familiarity with their lived experience. Instead, it requires a willingness to listen, learn and change our behavior accordingly.\r\nMental health care professionals can further support Black mental health by looking into their own practices, acknowledging their biases and altering their care accordingly. Ultimately, every client who walks through the door deserves to be met with empathy and cultural understanding.\r\nIn addition to investigating our own biases, practitioners must educate themselves on health disparities between groups. A 2008  found that white individuals have more access to quality mental health support and professional help — and they are met with more empathy when seeking treatment.\r\nClinicians should consider socioeconomic inequalities when determining practice fees. Adjusted rates could be a step toward presenting better care opportunities for people of color who seek mental health treatment. Some private practices and facilities currently use sliding fee scales, charging clients based on what is doable for their household income rather than a flat rate fee. This is a start and needs to be adopted by all of the mental health world, including hospitalization facilities.\r\nThe mental health care system also needs to keep up with the appropriate language to use in a clinical setting. Clinicians, support groups and anyone engaging in a dialogue about mental health need to consider the inherent trauma that people of color have lived generationally in order to provide unbiased, nonjudgmental support. Using a dated term or unfamiliar language can be incredibly triggering for someone who has experienced severe discrimination and marginalization.\r\nYearly trainings and seminars can help providers better understand cultural triggers. Clinicians, support groups and non-profits need to continually undergo cultural understanding and awareness trainings to stay at the forefront of the discourse and to provide the best, culturally competent care.As a clinician who lives with a mental health disorder, I have taken a personal journey to work toward cultural competence and empathy for all my clients. I do not always get it right — and in those moments, it is critical to recognize my mistakes and work to address it with my client. Often, an apology can go a long way. But this means very little without understanding and measurable growth.In my practice, I continually participate in webinars and trainings for cultural competence, and I devote time to reading on the topic on my own. “Social Justice in Clinical Practice” by Belkin Martinez and Fleck-Henderson has added to my understanding of injustices occurring in the medical space and more broadly, and it has given me a blueprint for how I, as a white clinician, can work to restore social justice in my practice and beyond.Having cultural competence and empathy, to me, does not mean simply addressing the issue in my practice, but speaking up on a larger scale. It is when those of privilege stay silent that injustice prevails. This always plays in my mind in order to work toward change.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "By Luna  GreensteinTraveling has countless benefits: learning, exploring, trying new things, to name just a few. As the quote goes, “Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer.” Every adventure can be a life experience, worth the time, money and even the potential conflicts.When leaving your usual routine and entering new territory, challenges might come up. One challenge is that traveling may cause symptoms of a mental health condition to flare. Even though being symptomatic isn’t completely avoidable, here are a few tips on how to reduce stress and manage symptoms during a trip:Being spontaneous while traveling is part of the fun, but a little bit of planning can save a lot of hassle. , so trying to prevent stressful situations is important. Here are a few ways to prepare:  Plan time in your itinerary to rest and recuperate, especially if you are packing activities into everyday. This will allow you to process your new experiences and prevent you from feeling overwhelmed. Also, many major airlines offer day passes to their lounges for a fee. Lounges provide a much quieter, more relaxing experience than waiting in the hustle at the gate.Whether you are strolling around a museum or lounging on the beach, you should keep your medication with you.

    "description": "President Obama submitted his proposed federal budget for 2013 to Congress this week. As expected, it’s controversial. Much of the debate leading into the fall’s elections will be over what programs should be cut and how much taxes should be raised—if at all—on high income Americans in order to reduce the federal government’s deficit, let alone pay down the national debt.As part of the debate, there will be choices important to individuals and families affected by mental illness, regardless of political party. Mental illness does not discriminate. It affects Republicans, Democrats and Independents alike.For example, the President’s proposal  in Medicare and Medicaid payments over 10 years, in part by cutting payments to providers. It also would freeze the National Institutes of Health budget, which is the source for scientific research into mental illness. Along with disability income, housing and other practical needs, these areas make the difference for treatment and recovery.The squeeze on Medicaid especially affects state mental health care systems. In November, 2012, NAMI released a  that outlined the impact of that squeeze, along with state budget cuts.Expect state budget crises to continue. This past week, debate in several states and the impact of cuts—and rising demand—filled headlines in , ,  and . In Florida, posted  of a protest that raised public awareness of the local impact of a proposed $91 million cut in state mental health care.“If I didn’t have this service, I probably would be homeless,” Jeffrey Vassey, a 55-year-old man living with schizophrenia told the paper.Budget debates speak in terms of trillions, billions, millions and thousands of dollars, depending on the size of the community—national, state or local.It’s easy to lose perspective.At the ground level, however, the perspective is easy. Mental health care often makes the difference between living on the streets and moving toward recovery.

    "description": "Since my first involvement in 1988, nearly everyone I have spoken to in NAMI has described their dream of a time when mental illness can be discussed in public as an important issue worthy of public support and understanding. I began to understand the significance of these dreams and soon started dreaming of the same thing myself.From the very beginning of the NAMI movement, part of the challenge was always the need to educate the public about serious mental illness—to let people know that mental illness, like diabetes and heart disease is an illness like any other, that it is indiscriminate in nature, that recovery is possible when the appropriate treatment is available, and that NAMI provides hope for individuals with a serious mental illness, for their families and for their communities.This challenge seemed insurmountable at times. By the beginning of the 21st century, NAMI had built an extensive and powerful national network of advocates and the capacity to begin to initiate the conversations necessary to help people better understand the impact that mental illness has on their community. What was needed was a vehicle that allowed advocates to initiate these conversations on a scale that would begin to make a difference. The NAMIWalk program has provided the perfect opportunity to begin these important conversations.NAMIWalks marks its 10th anniversary in 2012. Since its beginning, NAMIWalks has grown significantly and has become a “community walk for mental illness awareness” and the perfect way to engage every part of the communities that host these events. As each of these walks continues to grow, the opportunities to educate the public and to change the way people see serious mental illness will grow as well. We are approaching the point when these walks stop being so much about ‘walking for NAMI’ and more about ‘communities walking to raise awareness about mental illness.’ As that happens, some of our long held dreams will begin to come true.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "I always hesitate to write about music. It tends to date me. My kids roll their eyes whenever I mention the 1970s, let alone folk rock. In the car, there’s a constant battle over which radio stations or CDs to play.Every now and then, however, there’s a song that resonates and bridges the generational divide. These days, the song is  by the band fun. It strikes a chord somehow with teenage angst and inspires my own kids to rally forward.“Carry On” strikes a chord in me as well, rooted in past battles with depression. Its message is an exhortation, a call to arms and an affirmation of faith. It also has caused me to remember the song that touched me when I was 16 years old—long before I learned that my moodiness was only a hint of worst things to come. Arlo Guthrie sang , which is partly about coming of age in the tumultuous decade between 1961 and 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther songs reflect the same theme. In 2001, Gospel singer Yolanda Adams’   was a call for personal perseverance, but also provided encouragement and hope to a stunned, grief-stricken nation after the terrorist attacks of 9/11.An important distinction is that such songs are inspirational in nature, encouraging listeners to draw on inner strength. They don’t wallow in sadness or pain. I’ve always liked Gilbert O’Sullivan’s  “,” but face it, the fact that in the lyrics, he is on his way to throw himself off a tower doesn’t do much for inspiring a person to hold on.From a biological perspective, music can calm stress and elevate mood by increasing levels of serotonin or dopamine in the brain. Music can literally lift and energize a person’s spirits, helping to overcome anxiety or depression.Tunes and lyrics also stir memories. Music from a pleasurable time and place can therapeutically put people living with depression “back in touch” with important parts of themselves, helping to pull them out of isolation inside their own minds.Thirty years ago, I was struggling with depression, unemployed and disconnected from most of my friends who lived in other cities. Turning points in my recovery came when a close college friends stopped for a night en route from Vermont to Michigan. As we talked into the night, he put one of my records on stereo— by the Beatles—which we had listened to many times together several years before. One song was particularly apt:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that moment I realized that it had been over a year since I had listened to music for music’s sake. It had been part of my withdrawal from the world and suppression of my energy and strength.Turning the music back on helped turn me back on.It doesn’t matter what decade you’re from. Carry on. Don’t ever give up the fight.Share your strength.Tell us the songs that inspire you.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "Last week, I had the opportunity to meet briefly with former first lady Rosalynn Carter in Atlanta after she filmed a public service announcement in support of NAMI Georgia’s  initiative. “Please help … build a circle of support in your community and put self-directed recovery within our reach,” Mrs. Carter asked.Gracious, genuine, committed—as I watched her speak these were some of the words that came to mind. I reflected on this amazing woman and her role in changing our global understanding of mental illness.Mrs. Carter was the first wife of a presidential candidate to declare a campaign promise of her own. Her promise? As first lady, she would assume the responsibility for guiding legislative reform on behalf of the nation’s individuals living with mental illness.Expanding on efforts she initiated as first lady of Georgia, this is exactly what she did after her husband was elected President in 1976. This is remarkable on its own, but to put this in perspective, to say that America’s awareness of mental illness was very much in the dark in the 70s is an understatement; treatment options were in most cases nonexistent and mothers were blamed for their children’s mental illness. To further demonstrate the reality of this era, NAMI was not founded until 1979, three years after Carter’s inauguration.A true pioneer, Mrs. Carter’s compassion and dedication on behalf of individuals and families affected by mental illness has not wavered in the more than 35 years since. Even a partial list of her accomplishments in this arena is eye-opening:Her drive to aid individuals living with mental illness all began during a 1966 encounter early one morning while campaigning for her husband’s bid to become governor of Georgia. Mrs. Carter came upon a stooped and weary woman heading home to care for a daughter with mental illness. She was so moved by her love and dedication that she launched a personal crusade that continues today.From the world stage to a corner of her home state, last week, more than 45 years later, she reminds us that we have a lifetime champion who will embrace all efforts, large and small, in support of improving our lives, our families and our communities.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Enough is Enough: Regulate Restraint and Seclusion in Schools ",
    "description": "The need to regulate restraint and seclusion in our nation’s schools just gained significant momentum with the release of a new report and an NPR  that highlights the need for immediate action. ProPublica  released by the U.S. Department of Education showing that there were 267,000 instances of restraining or secluding children in schools in one school year. The NPR article highlights an incident in which a young boy with autism panicked after being threatened with seclusion. When school officials tried to force him into the “quiet area” a small locked room, bones in his hand were crushed.Despite claims that schools are limiting the use of restraint and seclusion, these unacceptably high numbers suggest otherwise. Some schools reported restraining or secluding students dozens and even hundreds of times each year. In 75 percent of these cases, restraint and seclusion was used with children with a disability including mental illness. Many of these instances of restraint and seclusion were improperly used when an emergency did not exist.Congress has introduced The Keeping All Students Safe Act (, ) to protect children from the unnecessary and harmful use of restraint and seclusion. This legislation allows restraint to be used when a student’s behavior poses an immediate danger of physical harm to that student or anyone else. For example a student may be restrained if they are striking other students, banging their head against the wall, “gouging their eyes”, or other related behaviors. In cases when restraint is used, the bill requires schools to notify the child’s parents and work with them to plan ways to better manage difficult behaviors in the future. The Keeping All Students Safe Act fosters a positive learning environment in schools by promoting interventions that help minimize disruptive classroom behaviors and instructing school staff in more effective ways of addressing students who may be in crisis.Momentum is building for this legislation and we urge you to be a part by  to ask for their support and to use their leadership to move the legislation forward to a vote.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in March 2011. Singing, she believes, has helped her to persevere.“I want to show people that  doesn’t define who you are,” she said. In doing so, she has struck a powerful blow against stigma and discrimination.NAMI members cheered and applauded in their living rooms. For those who were watching with their parents or teenage children, it was an emotional moment.The moment carried even greater emotion as Shelby sang “Temporary Home” by Carrie Underwood. The refrain can serve as a metaphor in the journey toward recovery:Both the video and vocal performance can be seen on many websites, including Talking publicly about your mental illness not only can help strike a blow against stigma, it can be part of recovery itself. It can liberate a person from feelings of stigma. It can stop a person from internalizing shame or fear. Besides being a step toward recovery taken for herself, Shelby’s audition serves as an example that can inspire others. That’s one of the principles on which NAMI’s public education program  also rests.So what happens next?The audition judges selected Shelby to compete as a semi-finalist in Hollywood. Contestants will be eliminated until a winner is selected by the audience in the final episode in May.I think NAMI members will know who they want to vote for.Keep singing, Shelby.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Language, Stigma and Political Correctness: How We Talk about Mental illness ",
    "description": "NAMI recently engaged in a dialogue with National Public Radio () over language, stigma and mental illness. It in turn led to discussion of what is meant by “political correctness.”It started with NPR’s coverage of a pending  in which a man is appealing a conviction for falsely claiming to have received the Congressional Medal of Honor. In an interview with the man’s lawyer, NPR reporter  asked whether his client, a habitual liar, was a “nutcase.”NPR received many complaints. In consultation with NAMI, the NPR Ombudsman column on its website   about language, stigma and mental illness.NAMI pointed them to the  on Mental Health, which frames stigma as a public health issue. We also acknowledged that assessing stigma can involve “balancing” several considerations. Particularly in entertainment media, NAMI’s “red flags” of stigma include:In the case of the NPR interview, “nutcase” waved at least three red flags. First, the context: it was used to describe a person (Description of a legal argument as “nutty” for example would not have been as great a concern).” Second, the word is often used to describe people disparagingly—with at least a suggestion that they live with mental illness. Finally, the word has an almost cartoonish impact that tends to trivialize mental illness, devaluing it as a social concern.One of the best strategies in fighting stigma is to turn protest into dialogue. Dialogue does not necessarily lead to agreement, but it does heighten awareness and potentially connect to broader social concerns.That’s exactly what happened in this case.One NPR listener complained: “I’m sick to death of political correctness rules ... we use words like 'nutcase,' there's no reason to avoid them.\"NPR’s Ombudsman replied: “Political correctness can surely get out of hand, but stop and think for a minute: It is highly likely that you or a family member or friend has at some point had some kind of mental illness.“We often stigmatize it in ways that we no longer do with physical ailments, or race, or any of a number of human conditions. Calling someone a \"nutcase\" for something they can't help and others may share is out of bounds.”The mention of “political correctness” led to  in the next NPR Ombudsman column.And then a One can empathize with people who sometimes feel that there’s too much “political correctness” today. But what does the phrase actually mean? Shouldn't we always try to do the right thing? Shouldn’t there be civic dialogue about language and attitudes? In many respects, invoking political correctness is only a way to duck an issue, rather than consider it.What do you think? What do you consider most stigmatizing? Language, stereotypes, offensive symbols or something else?Does the mental health community’s concern about stigma ever reach a point of too much political correctness?We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

The first season, which premiered in 2011, follows Carrie’s efforts to uncover a U.S. Marine who is thought to have been turned while trying to target an Al-Qaeda kingpin while she struggles with (and hides) her mental illness from everyone but her sister.The juxtaposition between Carrie’s determination to do her job well and sacrifice everything—including her own mental health—while unraveling a mystery reels the viewer in.

She's so capable in so many ways and in others she's so ultimately unreliable.”As Carrie’s authority is undermined by the discovery of her illness by coworkers, her mania also serves as a useful tool and helps her begin to solve the case.

Additionally, it reveals the stigma surrounding mental illness in a job that requires a cool head and a sharp mind—her validity instantly goes out the window. In the end, Carrie’s bipolar depression is so severe and unresponsive that she elects to undergo … just as she remembers a key element to the plot.What’s crucial about this television series is its realistic portrayal of mental illness as well as real life—how in a matter of days mental illness can turn a life upside down, how peers, loved ones and coworkers can turn on you. How you start to doubt your own reality, and even how people can manipulate that reality. What’s really key, though, is that Carrie as a person, her work and her passion come first: Her mental illness is simply another hurdle she must overcome. Her illness is seen on the same playing field as countless other hurdles in her life, from political schemers to master plots of terrorism and deception to a strained family life.\"Playing someone with bipolar and taking the mystery out of that is a responsibility I don't take lightly,\" Danes said. “I really spent a lot of time doing my research to make it a specific portrayal and not just a generalized portrait of ‘being crazy.’ I didn't want to play crazy—that’s not bipolar disorder.\"We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Go Away Evil: Global Mental Health and Traditional Healers ",
    "description": "While making  a documentary about the impact of my father’s mental illness on our relationship, I became interested in global mental health. I soon learned that it is the most ignored of all health areas.In truth, global mental health is the most global of all health areas. Think about it: many illnesses like malaria only affect certain parts of the globe.I started to film mental health stories outside the United States, interviewing leaders and advocates. This summer, a new website, Take5Now.com, will be launched where these stories and other resources will be brought to life. It is intended to foster interactive dialogue about mental health from a global perspective.To stay informed about theexact launch date for Take5Now.com, please join You can also view a five-minute film, , right now on YouTube. The film was shot in South Africa about a woman, Buyiswa, living with . When Buyiswa started hearing voices in her twenties her mother took her to a traditional healer who gave her herbs. Nothing improved.Spending time in South Africa I learned how traditional and religious healers are indeed where many Africans go for mental health care. This is the same throughout Africa, India and in many other countries.Most developing countries spend less than one percent of their health budgets on mental health and eight out of 10 people with severe mental illness go untreated. Educational campaigns that link mental illness to a bio-medical paradigm are practically nonexistent. Consequently, in many low income countries the age-old explanations of demon possession and spells cast by jealous neighbors persist.Filming globally for my other upcoming film on global mental health, people shared with me instances of being physically abused, from hair pulling to beating, by traditional healers. I questioned these stories at first because they sounded too cliché, but as I heard more of them, I was forced to accept the sad truth of their reality.While there can be harm caused by traditional healers, whether through physical abuse or ineffectiveness, to advocate for doing away with them would nonetheless be counter-productive. The healers are an integral part of a community and often bring comfort and understanding to many individuals and their families.For  I interviewed a traditional healer and watched many of her clients chat with her and collect herbs and pieces of fur. I could feel the strong rapport she had with them.I have been excited to learn about programs that train traditional healers about serious mental health. Trainings focus on which individuals could benefit from Westernized approaches to mental health treatment. The good news is that many healers welcome the training. They are grateful for being recognized and respected by the larger health establishment. Meanwhile it is reassuring to know that many developing countries are finally realizing the burden that mental illness imposes on its citizens. They have begun to dedicate more resources toward services and treatments. Studies show that psychological and pharmacological interventions are cost-effective in developing countries. In fact, they are just as cost-effective as antiretroviral treatment for . As evidence-based interventions increase, the sole reliance on traditional healers in many parts of the world will diminish.The challenge is to empower all players in all communities to have the knowledge and resources to help end suffering and to foster connections between us.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "My son was 8 years old the first time a doctor told me he had a psychotic illness. My stunned reaction and the look of confusion on my face prompted the doctor to ask, “Do you know what psychotic means?”Yes, I knew the meaning of the word psychotic, but I could not imagine it describing my son. I knew him as wildly imaginative, dark and moody, prone to violent temper tantrums, unrealistically fearful and overly attached to me, but psychotic? No way. The doctor went on to explain his clinical findings and advised a complete neurological evaluation to rule out possible medical explanations. If no neurological issues were identified, I was advised to contact a psychiatrist so that my son could begin taking anti-psychotic medications, as soon as possible. That was quite an afternoon; it marked the end of our “normal” life, and the beginning of a journey my son, Matthew, and I are still traveling.After the initial shock of hearing the diagnosis of  my first reaction was denial. The doctor must be wrong. Then as reality began to come into focus, I experienced the full range of emotions most often associated with grief including: anger, depression and a sense of loss. Finally, I came to an acceptance of my son’s mental illness and began learning all that I could about the disease, treatments, resources and support networks. I became determined to become an effective advocate for my child.As a parent of someone with , I realized what an important role I played in my son’s wellbeing. If you love someone with a mental illness, you too may be the only person standing in the gap between them and homelessness, jail, abuse or suicide. At times, you may need to be their voice when they cannot speak for themselves or no one listens. Or, you may need to do the leg work involved in locating mental health services and building a support network. At others, you may need to make tough, difficult decisions that break your heart; but, if not you, who?Being proactive in your advocacy is the best course of action. Hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst. Contact your  or State Organization for information, support groups and referrals to local services. Line up a trusted group of professionals: a psychiatrist, therapist, and social worker/case manager. Become familiar with your community mental health center or clinics. Apply for disability assistance, either Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Income () which will make it possible to access  or . Learn about supported housing and employment options. There is help available, but resources are limited. Being patient, but persistent with mental health professionals and service providers gets the best results. However, it you believe your loved one is being abused, falsely accused, or discriminated against a lawyer may need to represent their rights.  Overtime, Matthew and I have needed to rely on all these resources.It has been twenty years since Matthew and I began this journey. He is living with schizophrenia, and I am his mom. Schizophrenia has affected every aspect of his life, but it does not define him.

    "title": "When Stigma Struck Out: The Jimmy Piersall Story",
    "description": "By Bob  CarollaJimmy Piersall was one of the greatest outfielders of the 1950s and 60s. He played 17 seasons, most notably with the BostonRed Sox, the Cleveland Indians, and the New York Mets. He won two Golden Glove awards and twice was selected for major league baseball’s All-Star Team.Still, he has said: “Probably the best thing that ever happened to me was going nuts. Whoever heard of Jimmy Piersall until that happened?”His mental illness—specifically bipolar disorder—played out publicly at a time when mental illness usually was kept hidden. Piersall was born in 1929. Growing up, he was popular, but “high-strung” and a “worrier,” who suffered severe headaches. His mother lived with depression and was hospitalized many times.He had a temper—and an insecurity that could turn to paranoia. In 1952, the Red Sox promoted Piersall from their farm team, the Birmingham Barons, but he learned that the team intended to play him\r\nat shortstop. In his memoir, Fear Strikes Out, Piersall recalls thinking: “It’s impossible. I’m not a shortstop. I’m a center fielder. [The shift] might ruin me. Wait a minute. I’ll bet that’s just what they want to do.” Fear of failure came at a time when he had been married only a few years, with two young children, and was providing full financial support for his parents.Flashes of temper early in the season turned into a violent brawl with Yankee Billy Martin on May 24, 1952. Later in the game, he fought with one of his own teammates, and then broke down crying after he was benched.Even after he was shifted to the outfield, Piersall’s behavior grew increasingly bizarre—which, ironically, endeared him to fans, who enjoyed the spectacle. He spread his arms like an airplane while running bases and mimicked the mannerisms of other players. In a game with the St. Louis Browns on June 11, he taunted pitcher Satchel Paige, calling out “oink, oink, oink” from first base.“That boy is sick,” said Paige, one of the few people who recognized what was happening.On June 20, the Red Sox sent Piersall back to Birmingham in the hope it would “straighten him out.” Instead, he was thrown out of four games and suspended. On July 20, newspapers reported he would “take a rest” on the advice of his physician.Two weeks later, Piersall woke up in restraints at Westborough State Hospital in Massachusetts. He had received electroshock therapy and did not remember much of the previous year. His teammates visited him in the hospital. He received hundreds of letters from fans. He thought his career was over, but the Red Sox brought him back for the 1953 season. In 1954, Piersall told his story on a local television show in Chicago, leading to an outpouring of support. He expanded his disclosure in a two-part story in the Saturday Evening Post, entitled “They Called Me Crazy—and I Was,” which led to the publication of Fear Strikes Out in 1955. Two years later, the book was made into a movie with the same title, starring Anthony Perkins and Karl Malden. “Mental illness is no different from any kind of illness,” observed Piersall’s doctor in the film. The magazine series, book, and movie delivered a powerful anti-stigma message on a national scale.Piersall adopted an attitude of laughing at his illness. He cultivated a persona based on “zany antics.”In 1959, Piersall was traded to the Cleveland Indians. Once, he pulled out a water pistol and squirted an umpire. Another time, his teammates had to rescue him after he challenged Yankee fans to a fight. He didn’t hesitate to confront hecklers who made mean-spirited slurs about mental illness.In 1963, Piersall hit his 100th home run while playing for the New York Mets. He celebrated by running the bases facing backwards. Soon after, Mets manager Casey Stengel, a colorful personality in his own right, announced he was letting Piersall go because “there was room for only one clown on the team.”Piersall finished his playing career in 1967 with the Los Angeles Angels. He became outfield instructor for the Texas Rangers and a broadcaster for the Chicago White Sox.After being fired for feuding with the White Sox management, he wrote a second memoir The Truth Hurts (1985)—in which he provided additional detail about his illness.Some might argue that Piersall perpetuated stigma through outrageous behavior and embrace of language like “crazy.” But that is perhaps too easy to say in 2008. Fifty years ago, going public with mental illness was like breaking the sound barrier. The sonic boom has echoed through the years.In 2009, Piersall will turn 80. He hasn’t made baseball’s Hall of Fame, but his name is included on NAMI’s “Famous People” poster, which honors individuals whose mental illnesses have enriched our lives.This article is based on Piersall’s autobiography, , and reporting by Dom Amore; “Quite The Character,” Hartford Courant (APSE Writing Competition 1999); Bob Dolgan, “One of a Kind,” Baseball Digest (December 1, 2001); Mike Puma, “A Hall of Fame Personality,” ESPN.com (May 24, 2004); and Jeff Merron, “Mystery Man,” 108 Magazine (Summer 2007).

    "title": "Having an Impact: Reporter Meg Kissinger and Her Brother Jake ",
    "description": "The  presented its top award this past weekend to the for a series published earlier this year, titled “Imminent Danger.”The series probed the issue of involuntary commitment for mental illness, based on the legal standard of “imminent danger to oneself or others.”Only one percent of people with severe mental illness can be considered “dangerous,” the newspaper reported, while noting also that a punch or a shove was included in the definition relative to other forms of violence.  resulted in strong reactions in the mental health community (pro and con). Discussion of violence (and the title) risked perpetuating stigma around mental illness while involuntary treatment is an issue that often splits mental health advocates.As part of the series, the published an editorial,  which highlighted measures ranging from advanced directives to mental health courts. Overall, the project reflects the newspaper’s long-standing commitment to mental health issues.Meg Kissinger is the reporter at the center of that mission. She is also one of only a few\r\n who have a sustained interest in the mental health care system. It is partly rooted in her family background.Earlier this month, she published  about her brother Jake’s experience living with mental illness titled “Can Adult Siblings Connect When Mental illness is in the Mix?” When Jake was 4 years old, he saved Meg’s life by running for help after she fell into a lake and almost drowned.“Jake's real name is John Matthew, after my dad's older brother who was killed during World War II. This gave Jake a distinction as the white buffalo of our family, the rare and revered one who seemed to float above the fray,” Meg wrote.A motivated and vivacious teen, Jake was an Eagle Scout. However, Jake ultimately dropped out of college. He now lives in a group home near Chicago, but is considering a move back to Milwaukee.Jake was the third of eight children in the family. Meg was the fourth.Meg became a reporter in part because of  her unique vantage point as the fourth child. She was always curious. Within the family, she was the one who often could report to members of the family what other members were doing. (Her status as a middle child may also be responsible for the “balanced” perspective that marks much of her work).Meg’s first story about mental illness in the  was a reminiscence in 1986 about the suicide of her sister, Nancy, eight years before. The second was in 1998, after her brother, Danny, also died from suicide.Reluctant at first, she wrote the second story “because it was important”—as much as any about heart disease or diabetes that often are published.Those stories “galvanized” Meg’s professional direction. Her managing editor, George Stanley, has encouraged that direction allowing her to continuing filing in-depth special reports, including  in 2010.At one point, Meg was inspired by the contrast between her brother Jake’s living conditions and those of other people living with mental illness in Milwaukee. Her reporting sparked local action to increase housing for people with mental illness by about 500 units.She takes the greatest pride in stories that having an impact.After reporting on so many parts of a broken mental health care system, Meg hopes to focus next on programs that work. But, it also will mean comparing them to programs that don’t.Meanwhile, Meg’s story of her relationship with her brother Jake is . It certainly moved me.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog! We feature the latest research, stories of recovery, ways to end stigma and strategies for living well with mental illness.

    "title": "Family Caregivers and the Gift of Hope and Healing ",
    "description": "Caregivers who are active in NAMI’s  education program gathered in Dallas recently to participate in a video project aimed at capturing the essence of their life experiences. When finished, NAMI intends to use the video to help convey the heart and spirit of the Family-to-Family program to national, state and community leaders and others who, in turn, can support it through financial assistance, referrals and other means.As one of NAMI’s , Family-to-Family is offered free in communities across the country to any caregiver of an adult living with a . Over 300,000 people have taken the course, but there are millions more in need.The course consists of 12 classes, each of which covers different aspects of mental illness, family relationships and coping skills.I was one of the producers for the video project, joining a talented crew from CloudTen, a creative marketing firm. I assisted with the scheduling and participation of each of the eight individuals who were interviewed on camera.CloudTen is a new agency formed by a group of major agency veterans from the Dallas market. Their vision is to help brands, companies and causes impact the world for the better. Advertising that works at the Cloud 10 level really impacts people emotionally and that is the goal with every project from brochures to social media to TV spots.On site in Dallas, a simple production set—lights, cameras and a single red chair in front of a stark white backdrop—was transformed into a magical tapestry of rich stories and the beauty of human experience. As I watched and listened, one person after another shared their truths by telling personal stories.Themes were constant throughout:  humility, hope and caring.One-by-one, they talked about helping family members who had developed mental illness and how it changed their lives. Guilt, grief, anger, sadness and isolation were the words used to describe their initial encounter with mental illness.One in four adults experiences a mental health disorder in a given year. One in 17 lives with a serious mental illness. Each of the caregivers participating in the video project represents one of the millions of families affected by mental illness. They spoke to chaos and confusion they felt when they realized that a child or parent or sibling was ill— and how little they knew about their medical condition, treatment or recovery.They did not know what to do.That is, until they found NAMI and the Family-to Family program.Gradually, through the course, feelings of despair and confusion were replaced with understanding, hope, strength and relief. Confusion became confidence. Their role in helping their loved ones became much clearer and helped to “normalize” their experience.The Family-to Family participants shared their stories for the project. They talked about how their family members are now doing. Because of the new focus and coping strategies acquired through the program, they talked about dramatic, positive changes. They talked about a newfound strength in family relationships and their commitment to others.Though their testimony, the participants will be helping families who are only now beginning to travel the road that they already have—just as they received strength from families who traveled before them.As a free education course, Family-to-Family is both a gift to be received and in some cases presented in turn others. All of the trained instructors have taken the course themselves and have a loved one living with mental illness.Before the video event, I thought I understood the concept of unconditional acceptance and understanding as a powerful tonic for individuals and families seeking recovery and understanding. Now, I recognize that this is not only potent but perhaps essential.The help and hope that NAMI gives to others in need is the most remarkable gift we have to offer. We humbly thank all the members, supporters and grassroots volunteers who enable us to make a difference.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Cognitive Behavior Therapy and Young Adults: An Interview with a CBT-trained Clinician",
    "description": "Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an empirically validated form of therapy. This means it has been scientifically studied and found to be effective in addressing various mental illnesses that individuals experience. CBT focuses on the interaction of thoughts, feelings and behaviors and how these different components correspond to different mental illnesses (e.g., anxiety and mood disorders).With CBT, a clinician works with an individual to understand how automatic, negative thoughts can contribute to emotional feelings as well as physical feelings and how the individual can engage in positive behaviors that help to manage these feelings. Behaviors can be adaptive or maladaptive, meaning behaviors can lead to healthier levels of functioning or can lead to poorer levels of functioning.When I talk about CBT, I describe it as a form of coaching. The clinician is more like a coach who helps individuals practice thinking rationally, managing emotions effectively and developing healthy ways to cope with symptoms. CBT is a collaborative, two-person model so time is spent helping individuals feel comfortable talking about issues and helping them understand that these issues will be addressed collaboratively.CBT is also a strength-based treatment so it does not focus on vulnerabilities or weaknesses but rather it offers the opportunity to develop strengths. The clinician will talk about how to use the capacities individuals already have to address the issues they are facing.People often assume, rightly or not, that therapy is about digging into unconscious conflicts that are responsible for symptoms. This is a very old way of looking at the therapeutic relationship.The word I use most to describe CBT is collaborative. It is two individuals in a room who are working on a common goal. As a result, CBT-trained clinicians are usually engaging, interactive and instructive. They do not just empathetically listen. They are there to help problem-solve and address troublesome symptoms that are getting in the way of an individual’s life.CBT-trained clinicians focus on identifying practical strategies and adapting different behaviors to support recovery. They may talk about the dynamics behind symptoms, but this is not where they start. They typically start with the individual’s goals.This is different from what clinicians typically do in traditional forms of psychotherapies. They usually do a lot less talking and teaching and only focus on the specific mental illness that is present.CBT is used for a variety of illnesses. At first, CBT focused mostly on mood disorders and anxiety. However, now it is used with lots of different mental illnesses, including schizophrenia, psychotic disorders, substance use disorders and personality disorders.Once an individual learns about the CBT model, in terms of how thoughts, feelings and behaviors correspond with each other, it can be used to address many different, diagnosable mental illnesses as well as normal changes in feelings and behaviors.Oftentimes, CBT-trained clinicians will start the first session with an assessment of how well the individual is functioning and what specific issues he or she is there to address and how significant these issues are in his or her life.There is a lot of initial talk about what the individual is experiencing and how his or her symptoms are impacting relationships, work, school, etc. Clinicians also take time to understand the onset of the issues the individual is experiencing and their clinical course. For example, they may ask questions like: When did you first start experiencing symptoms? How have they changed throughout your life? How have they impacted different areas of your life?Most importantly, CBT-trained clinicians take time in the beginning to understand the individual’s treatment goals. It is important from the onset that they understand what the individual is looking for from treatment.In order to get the most out of treatment, coming up with goals is very important. Young adults should have a personal understanding of what they would like from treatment. Much more than other types of psychotherapy, CBT is collaborative, so the clinician is looking to understand what a young adult is looking to accomplish. This is going to direct the treatment itself. The clinician is there to help the young adult meet his or her goals.There are homework assignments with CBT. These assignments can include working on challenging automatic, negative thoughts, monitoring symptoms and finding new ways to cope with symptoms. Homework is important to get a sense of the progress being made between sessions. Young adults need to be motivated to work outside of the treatment sessions.I tell the young adults I work with that a lot of the work does not occur during the 50-minute sessions, but outside of the sessions. I openly encourage discussion via email and phone calls to get a sense of how my young adults are doing when we are not meeting.I recommend young adults use a notebook to jot down thoughts, particularly automatic, negative thoughts. This helps to get a sense of the anxiety or discomfort these thoughts create and how these thoughts are triggered in different situations (at home, in school, with friends, etc.).Luckily, it is easier to locate appropriate clinicians now more than ever. Young adults can just go online and Google CBT and the state they live in to bring up clinicians. I had my practice advertised over the internet and most of my colleagues do this too.Psychology Today () provides a wonderful tool that allows people to type in a zip code and a list of clinicians and their specialties pop up. Young adults may also contact insurance clinicians. When I enrolled in BlueCross BlueShield, they asked me what my specialties were. Young adults can call their insurance clinician to ask for a list of CBT-trained clinicians that work within their insurance network.There are clinicians who advertise that they do CBT but they actually do more traditional psychotherapy. Here are some questions parents and young adults can ask to ensure what a clinician is advertising is CBT:There are three top issues I often see in young adults:I recommend the following resources:I always enjoy books by David Barlow. Another author, David Burns, does a lot of contemporary work with CBT and has several self-help books that include specific strategies people can use to address negative thoughts.Strategies I recommend to young adults include:One thing I love about CBT is it is a very hopeful and optimistic, strength-based treatment. CBT-trained clinicians are using resources young adults already have to address the symptoms that are interfering with their functioning. Together, young adults and their clinicians can make a change. The clinician is a supportive person that young adults can be genuine with and trust. CBT is all about working together on common goals.  by Jonathan E.

    "title": "Closing the Gap for Children's Mental Health ",
    "description": "Half of all mental illness begins by age 14. Many people do not know that. They also do not know that, on average, eight to 10 years will pass from the onset of symptoms to the time of intervention for those living with these conditions. In the life of a child, those are critical developmental years.When children and youth living with mental illness have access to effective services and supports, they can develop close relationships with family and friends, learn to cope with challenging symptoms and gain the educational and social experiences they need to succeed in life.This week, as we observe  (May 9), there are two ways we can work to close the gap.First, is by getting schools involved in helping to identify struggling students and linking them with effective services. Second, is getting primary care providers involved.Let’s start with schools. Children spend about six hours a day in school. They often exhibit the first warning signs of mental health concerns while in school. Unfortunately, most of these children are not identified early and linked with services. Schools need more information about the early warning signs of mental illness, how to talk with families and how to help. For this reason, NAMI developed , an in-service education program that covers these topics. This program has been popular with many schools and gets them interested in learning more about children’s mental health. Please consider bringing it to your community. The  that accompanies the in-service program is also extremely popular with schools. So even if your school is not ready for the in-service program, please consider at least sharing the booklet to get the conversation started.Primary care providers, such as pediatricians and family doctors, are also natural allies in helping to close the gap. They see most children starting at a very young age and then over a number of years for well-child visits, vaccinations, illness, sports physicals and more. Primary care providers also are increasingly playing a role in addressing the mental health needs of children and youth because of the critical shortage of children’s mental health professionals.But more can be done to get them involved.NAMI has talked with families about their experiences with primary care providers. In a , they shared recommendations on how to make primary care offices more welcoming to conversations about mental health concerns and how to start these conversations. This led to the creation of  for primary care providers, including the publication of  Please consider sharing these resources with pediatric and family practice offices in your community. Emphasize the importance of primary care professionals making a commitment to identifying children and youth who may be struggling with an emerging mental illness.To observe National Children’s Mental Health Awareness Day, let’s make a commitment to close the gap so that children and youth with emerging mental illness can be identified early and linked with the services and supports they need to get a healthy start in life.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Veteran Success and Survival Depends on Advocacy",
    "description": "The National Alliance on Mental Illness Veterans and Military Council () advises NAMI leadership on issues of importance affecting the mental health of warriors, veterans and their families. Our nationwide network of members and supporters offers both a window into issues and an opportunity to support, educate and advocate at all levels. It is through these efforts that we attempt to raise awareness, improve quality of life and save lives of those who have served or are serving in the military and now suffer from or are at risk for mental illness.The month of May has been designated by Congress as  On Armed Forces Day, May 19, and on Memorial Day, May 28, and every day, we should recommit ourselves to increase awareness and advocacy at all levels.Opportunities for advocacy and collaboration are all around us, and here is one example of success:Recently, I attended a conference where those who have contributed to national advances in social work were presented with awards for their work and leadership. These awardees are people at the top of their profession, and I sometimes wonder if those “at the top” are in touch with those “in the trenches.” The evidence that many of them are both in touch and care about people came quicklyAs I watched the awards ceremony, I received an email from a young veteran, Joe, who lost his legs in combat. His recovery and upbeat attitude, including his selfless volunteer work that originally brought us together a couple of years’ ago, has been the subject of my continuing admiration. He is seemingly the model of recovery, but his email revealed the despair that often follows physical and mental wounds of trauma. In short, he needed a job to, as he said, “keep from going crazy.” He was reaching out for help. With  being double that of non-veterans across the nation, having a job and being productive is particularly important to both physical and mental health, financial well-being—and all the things, good or bad, that follow for veterans and their families.On my mind was a feeling of personal failure at not being able to derail the part of a recently passed law in my home state of Tennessee that eliminates the hiring points preference traditionally offered to veterans and spouses seeking state jobs.I feared that Joe and his family were among the first military victims of that unfortunate legislation.As I considered the email, I looked across the table and there sat a senior Veterans Health Administration () manager who had just received an award. I showed her the email, and she asked that I forward it to her and she would help.By the time I returned home, the evidence of her help and caring heart was immediately evident. I first received an email from a manager at , a company that provides jobs and job counseling to injured veterans and their family members. Secondly, I received a call the next day from a Veterans Administration counselor who helps veterans find housing and jobs. Joe and I talked about both of these opportunities and he was heartened with the speed, care and concern evident in those who were reaching out to help him.Probably the best part of this story is that Joe will help others and “pay it forward.” When he was injured, his wife and one baby girl were at home waiting. Now, Joe has two young daughters entering school, does more volunteer work than most of us, and looks forward to life and helping others. He is a true hero.The lesson for all of us is to constantly look for opportunities to advocate for warriors, veterans and their families, take action, never be intimidated and never get discouraged. I was surprised that so many people responded so quickly to Joe’s request.There are a lot of “Joes and Janes” out there. Many people are willing to help, but they cannot help if they do not know about them.I urge all of us to fervently advocate not just on the “special” days, such as , but every day! Write a letter or email, make a call or visit, share where you work or worship, and help reverse the epidemic of veteran unemployment and suicide and erase the stigma of seeking help for invisible wounds.Please share your thoughts and the happenings in your area either on the NAMI Facebook page or by participating in NVMC conference calls held the third Friday of each month at 1:00 p.m. EST. Call: 1 (888) 858-6021, and enter 739264#.I look forward to meeting many of you at this year’s  in Seattle. In addition to our Veterans and Military Council meetings, there are several very interesting and informative presentations by and for veterans, including the “Parity for Patriots” rally on Thursday, June 28. Please join us and show support for warriors, veterans and their families.On Armed Forces Day, please remember those who serve our country—and on Memorial Day those who sacrificed their lives in that service!We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "Mental illnesses are bipartisan, pervasive and have profound consequences for people’s lives. In the course of a year, about one in four people has a diagnosable mental illness every year. Almost everyone’s life has been touched in some way by mental illness. The face of mental illness is not the face of some stranger. It is the face of our neighbors and coworkers, our friends and family and sometimes us.The good news is that the rates of improvement for serious mental illness like major depression and bipolar disorder are as good as if not better than those for chronic physical diseases like heart disease and diabetes. These rates of improvement are predicated on the person getting the right treatment when they need it. The bad news is that notwithstanding the existence of effective treatments and services and the real opportunities for recovery, 80 percent of Americans with mental illnesses do not seek or find the help that they need.It is well documented that mental health care in this country is broken. The system that confronts families seeking care is too often fragmented, unorganized, and despite the best efforts by many, uneven at best in its quality. Too often what passes for the system of care sentences people to lifelong disability, the risk of premature death, and creates an impoverished underclass through poverty, crisis-focused care, treatment that relies primarily on medication, and the lack of supports in the community.Every day people contact NAMI seeking advice on how to access mental health services. People face difficulty finding inpatient and outpatient services, supportive housing, job supports, in-home supports, affordable health insurance, family support, medication, peer-directed and self- help programs and more. The time is now during these times of dramatic change in our  to push back against this discrimination and injustice and create a community care system that emphasizes early intervention and is flexible, accessible and integrated at all levels. None of these changes require additional study. It simply requires political and social will.As we approach Super Tuesday in the Republican Primaries we are reminded that health care is an important but contentious issue. However, the potential ramifications for individuals living with mental illness have not been discussed. We must remind the candidates that  means funding America’s future.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Promise and Patience in Understanding the Brain ",
    "description": "There is a growing recognition in both the U.S. and Europe that a fundamental understanding of how the brain works is an urgent priority.  This flows from the awareness that the public health burden of brain-based conditions is staggering, and that for the first time we have some truly promising tools to help us get there. This substantial scientific effort will take patience but it also holds much promise.The approaches on either side of the Atlantic are quite different. Given how much of what we know from drug discovery is rooted in good observation and chance, it is hard to predict what approach will yield the best results.In the U.S. President Obama announced the , which will “seek to map the circuits of the brain, measure the fluctuating patterns of electrical and chemical activity flowing within those circuits, and understand how their interplay creates our unique cognitive and behavioral capabilities.”In Europe the European Union’s  (HBP) seeks to model the human brain on supercomputers. Recently some scientists have formally criticized the EU approach, calling it premature. Regardless, both investments represent nearly simultaneous multiyear commitments to better understandings of the neuroscience we need so badly to advance care.Understanding the brain better does not mean mental conditions are only about genes or biology. An important principle is that environment impacts genes and gene expression—this concept is called epigenetics. Environment could mean protective elements like love and holding or risks like viruses at certain stages of neurodevelopment or traumatic experiences. It’s important to think both and not either-or when thinking of psychiatric conditions and the brain and environment.We have a greet deal to learn but have already come upon some important findings. We do know that the brain is more plastic—able to adapt and be shaped—than was first thought. Imaging the brain (fMRI, PET scans) have helped us move forward in basic functional understanding, but isn’t a clinically useful tool at this time.On the basic science side, two major recent breakthroughs stand out. First, the ability to generate stem cells from adult skin holds great promise. In 2014, scientists have looked at nerve cell responses taken from  to learn how they function differently than from people without bipolar disorder. Another recent basic science breakthrough is , which is the ability to impact specific cells through light and modified proteins. These are not yet clinically useful, but will teach us a great deal about the human brain. That knowledge will lead to better interventions.One of the challenges I have as NAMI’s Medical Director is cautioning patience even as I am so hopeful that novel scientific avenues will bear fruit. It is hard to know when and what new treatments and interventions can come from a more thorough understanding of the human brain. People want and deserve better treatments now, as there is a great deal of unmet need in the areas of brain disorders. Both a commitment to science to learn more and getting people what we already know works are essential.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Never Give Up Hope: Joplin and NAMI Volunteers Everywhere ",
    "description": "One year ago this week, tragedy struck Joplin, Mo.A tornado with winds over 200 mph destroyed 25 percent of the town. Seven thousand homes were destroyed. One hundred sixty-one people died. A thousand more were injured.About a month before, the largest outbreak of tornadoes ever recorded also struck 21 states. More than 350 people died as a result of those tornadoes. The death toll in Joplin—a single city—was nearly half that of the multi-state figure.In the wake of the destruction, one pressing concern was the mental health of the survivors, particularly that of the children.Two months after the tragedy, three deaths from suicide were attributed to posttraumatic stress and depression related to the tornado. Forty people  suicidal thoughts. Calls to the local crisis hotline quadrupled. One veteran who lives with PTSD said that the scene of destruction was worse than what he had  in Iraq.The NAMI Affiliate in Joplin played a part in the relief effort, collecting and delivering supplies and organizing free counseling sessions. NAMI Missouri has since posted a   on YouTube that commemorates NAMI Joplin’s efforts.Scrawled on one wall in the city was the message: “Mental health help. We have a compassionate ear. NAMI,” followed by the affiliate’s phone number.On another wall, someone painted in large letters: “Down, not out.”Inside the NAMI Joplin office, a sign declared: “Never give up hope.”NAMI takes great pride in its volunteers. So while thinking about  this week, I also am thinking about another NAMI member who volunteered as part of the relief effort in Alabama, following the earlier string of tornadoes.At the age of five, she came to the United States from a war-torn country.She lives with bipolar disorder, as well as , but has been doing well for years, she wrote in a recent email.While working as a caseworker for children in Alabama, the relief organization she was with, upon learning of her diagnosis, abruptly sent her home. They told her local chapter that they should never have sent her into a disaster zone. “They made assumptions about my disorder,” she wrote. The national organization tried to have her removed from the local chapter’s disaster relief team in her home state, but the team stood by her. Instead of working as a caseworker in the future, however, she can only register volunteers.In contacting me, she asked that I use her story to help spread awareness about the stigma and discrimination that people with mental illness face—from people who make assumptions and never take the time to know us.Her story left me thinking.In Joplin today, there are people living with PTSD.There also may be a few school children who years from now will experience onset of bipolar disorder, but will never forget the tornado and the help their families received from volunteers. They may even want to “pay it forward” by volunteering in some future disaster zone, drawing on the knowledge and empathy they acquired firsthand.Will they be turned away too?Let’s hope not, because they will have a lot to give.Down, but not out. Never give up hope.Thank you NAMI Joplin. Thank you NAMI volunteers everywhereWe’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "Ask 100 different people what work means to them, and you are likely to get 100 different responses. It can simply mean a source of income; it can provide a purpose; it can create order in life; it can be an opportunity for creativity and building something new; it can be a chance to help others.People with mental illness work successfully in a range of professions: at artists, scientists, famers, engineers, lawyers, construction, workers, chefs. Look anywhere and you will find people with mental illness leading and innovating.Yet, the reality in America is that many people with mental illness are either unemployed or underemployed. Bouts of illness, difficulty concentrating, trouble communicating with co-workers, medical appointments and absences from work can make getting and keeping a job difficult. Stigma and discrimination can also be great barriers to overcome.NAMI just released a report, , which explores the current state of mental illness and employment in the United States. It examines the reasons for low unemployment rates among people with mental health conditions, and describes the most effective supported employment programs that have been developed to date. The report is also a call to action for policymakers and advocates. It includes policy recommendations and model legislation that leaders could use to make supported employment programs available to the people who need them.Almost 80 percent of the nearly 7 million individuals served by the public mental health system in this country are unemployed. About 60 to 70 percent of these same people want to work and would work if they had appropriate support. The current employment support systems we have in place are simply not effective for most people with mental health conditions. It is time for a change.The good news is that there are  that have been studied, tested, and shown to help people with mental illness choose, get and keep a job. is a system that focuses on rapid placement in competitive employment and in jobs that match an individual’s talents and interests. IPS has a strong evidence-base shown to significantly improve the opportunities for people with mental illness to find and keep employment. are community centers open to anyone with a mental illness.

    "description": "These were my first thoughts when I was discharged from UCLA and Harris Methodist hospital in 2002 and again in 2007.I can remember like it was yesterday. Right after our art therapy class, when the nurses met with us one by one, I was shown my diagnosis. The reason it happened to me twice is because once I got stable footing after the initial episode in 2002 I came to the conclusion the medical system was completely unreliable and inaccurate in their “opinion” of my mental state and therefore I disregarded any “illness” they claimed I had.Then in 2007 after another severe manic episode I was diagnosed severe bipolar disorder type 1 the “Oh no, I have a mental illness” dialogue reared its head again in  head.Very often I like to poke and prod on this topic of self-imposed stigma when advocating because most of us either living with a diagnosed mental illness or those with a close family member have experienced it—or are still struggling in this area. Education and awareness take away the mystery and reduce the fear. We talk about society and “stigma” but I’m a firm believer that the first place to begin applying the anti-stigma campaign is with ourselves. There are plenty of avenues to help us reduce the crippling stigma we may be imposing on ourselves. So that we can enjoy the lives we were truly meant to live.Today we have several magazine publications, books, Internet sites and individuals speaking out about recovery and maintenance in every area of mental health. There are also some amazing authors, self-help books and daily positive affirmations to help us reprogram whatever negativity is going on in our heads.I’m really big on my “quiet time.” For me this is an everyday morning ritual which sets the pace for the rest of my day and hones those tough areas where my emotional challenges are still very sensitive. Hey, I’m nowhere out of the woods, I’m just now in harmony with them which is why I really love those “60 days,” “90 days” or “365 days” of affirmations, enlightenment, devotions or whatever you want to call them.The bottom line is they’re a wonderful guide for maintaining focus and mental health. Each morning there’s something new to keep me focused onand boy do I look forward to it. Also, included during this time is a moment of reflection; prayer; meditation. We may all call it different things but the essence is to allow your subconscious to have its way with those positive thoughts you’ve just planted there.Once we free ourselves from the bondage of thinking we are our diagnosis and are defined by it—versus something we treat and maintain daily in recovery—then what’s around us will soon shift and reflect our newly defined thoughts and aspirations.Some books I love: by Wayne Dyer by Joel OsteenWe’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "In 2008, Congress declared July as  (NMMHAM) in honor of author and advocate, Bebe Moore Campbell. Her close experience with a family member living with a severe mental health condition compelled Campbell to write multiple books on the topics of mental illness, treatment and recovery within a family setting. But she did not stop there.Campbell fervently believed that the national dialogue surrounding mental illness should acknowledge diverse communities. She became a prominent advocate for mental health education and support for minority populations. NMMHAM is inspired by Campbell’s efforts to include people of all communities and backgrounds in the national conversation on mental illness and increase awareness of mental health issues that, without distinction, affect us all.As Campbell emphasized, mental illness is associated with unique concerns for minority groups. Research shows that stigma towards mental illness is especially high in minority communities, making it more difficult for individuals to talk about their concerns with family members and peers and discouraging them from seeking treatment. In , “People of color…feel the stigma more keenly. In a race-conscious society, some don't want to be perceived as having yet another deficit”. People from culturally diverse groups often face additional barriers to mental health care such as financial cost, accessibility of treatment and language difficulties.Every person dealing with a mental health problem should have access to quality care. Every community should be aware of the importance of mental health, the sings of mental health conditions and where to find the support they need. This is why NMMHAM is an exceptional opportunity to spread the word about these issues, raise awareness and mobilize communities.During the month of July, to celebrate NMMHAM and honor Campbell’s legacy, NAMI State Organizations and Affiliates across the nation will be focusing on how we can better address the mental health needs of people from culturally diverse groups and increase awareness of minority mental health issues locally.The celebration kicked off on June 26 with an exciting legislative event organized by NAMI California at the State Capitol building in Sacramento. Together with Assemblyman Sebastian Ridley-Thomas, NAMI California leaders presented a  proclaiming July as National Minority Mental Health Awareness Month state-wide. At the event, a variety of speakers testified to the importance of recognizing minority mental health, including Senator Jim Beall, who recently led efforts to enforce mental health parity in the state budget, and individuals from diverse backgrounds who shared their experiences dealing with mental illness.Many additional exciting and creative events are planned for this month ranging from art shows and music festivals to educational presentations and forum discussions. We encourage you to join us in celebrating mental health awareness and diversity!  Here are some suggestions for things that you can do to spread the word about the importance of minority mental health:Mental illness affects people of all cultures, identities and backgrounds. Let’s promote awareness and encourage understanding this July. Let’s make a difference.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "I found NAMI New Jersey (NJ) through a self-help clearing house index. I was looking for a non-profit to volunteer with, as was my way when I was very ill and could not work. I was new in the area and had never heard of NAMI, but I figured if I was going to help a non-profit organization, I should help the one who helps people like me.So, I called. Right away I was invited to come to the office and talk. And so began our seven year relationship. I have stayed even while working because the stigma free environment is welcoming. For me, it is a good fit.I have been dealing with schizoaffective disorder for about 30 years. Up until five years ago, I existed in a state of psychosis and suicidal ideation. It was in this condition that I landed on NAMI’s doorstep.Don’t get me wrong, I had learned to mask my symptoms very well on the outside—25 years will do that for you. I was still very afraid of people. I had isolated myself through the course of my illness except for work when I could tolerate it, but the whole environment was welcoming.I started out as a volunteer in the office doing miscellaneous duties. I volunteered half a day every week. This responsibility helped in my attempt to rebuild my self-esteem. I had begun the in-and-out of the hospital cycle again, but I continued to volunteer when I wasn’t in the hospital.After about a year, the coordinator of  asked if I would join the advisory group. AACT-NOW is the African American mental health outreach program of NAMI NJ. I was shocked and honored that someone would value my input.At first, I felt inferior because I was the only consumer in the group, on disability and not working at the time. But, everyone treated me with warmth and respect and I soon forgot those feelings.After about a year, there was a documentary project coming to fruition which would showcase people of different cultures and their stories and concerns about living with a mental illness. They were looking for consumers of different cultures to volunteer. I volunteered as an African American consumer because I wanted to help humanize the face of mental illness for people in my community and everywhere else.I had a poem featured in the documentary, which was eventually named for my poem ().It was a courageous move on my part to undertake this project, but I hadn’t thought it through. After the film came debuted, I realized I was immortalized in that stage of my recovery on film. Now, five years later, I get choked up when I see it, because I remember the intense pain and depression I felt at that time, that I no longer feel now.After the film was debuted and started to circulate, I realized that I was “outed” anyway, so I decided to volunteer as a  presenter. This program sends consumers into the community to educate audiences on mental illness by telling their personal stories. I feel this is a very important tool for helping to eradicate stigma. So, I joined this program in addition to my other responsibilities as a volunteer at NAMI NJ.The next year I trained to be a facilitator for the consumer run support group .In the years following, I did appearances with the film, participated in panels at NAMI NJ state conference, the AACT-NOW conference, did a few poetry readings at NAMI NJ functions, and two book signings for my poetry chapbook in addition to the responsibilities mentioned before.I then decided that I would pursue a career in mental health as a peer support specialist. I took classes and managed to get a position at a major hospital in Central New Jersey. The main selling point for my being hired was my experience with NAMI NJ. Because of my involvement, peer classes and B.A., my resume was almost impeccable for the position. The “holes” in my resume were not closely scrutinized. One of the main requirements is that you be in mental health recovery yourself.Over these years, with NAMI NJ’s help, I have built up my self-esteem to the point that I am now building the foundation for a motivational/inspirational speaking career. Recently, I spoke at Tougaloo College’s Mental Health Week in Tougaloo, Miss. This past May I ran a workshop at the Intensive Case Manager Services (ICMS) Conference given by New Jersey Association of Mental Health and Addictions Agencies (NJAMHAA).When I first stepped into NAMI NJ, I never envisioned myself handling, accomplishing and enjoying the many responsibilities I have undertaken as a volunteer on behalf of the organization. I perceive these to be the things that put NAMI and NAMI NJ over the top for volunteering consumers:In the last seven years God, my family, my medical team and  have been instrumental forces in my recovery.I now know that no matter where I may move, I will seek out a NAMI office and volunteer doing something. I owe so much for NAMI New Jersey's continued support through my recovery process.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

I'm here to say that you can recover and go on to have a good life.On Sept. 25, 1987, I had a breakdown that was sudden, total and irreversible. A NAMI survey report, has revealed an average delay of 8.5 years between onset of schizophrenia symptoms and first treatment. I received the right help within 24 hours of my breakdown: I got sick on a Friday afternoon and by that Saturday morning, my mother drove me to the hospital.On the ward, I was given an antipsychotic medication, stayed for three weeks, and was released. My mother's courageous act—to get me the help I needed, no matter how it looked—made all the difference. I recovered because of my mother, Mary Ann Bruni. is the key to success. My story is hopeful and inspiring most of all to people diagnosed with mental illnesses. It shows that you don't have to go through endless hell and heartache before you get better. Yet it is also important that members of the public understand the need for quick action when a loved one develops .I'm 47 years old now, on the cusp of mid-life, and I've learned some things in recovery: take your medication every day as prescribed and talk with your psychiatrist honestly about what's going on. The one and only three-month drug holiday I went on caused me to relapse.Do the things you love, every day or as often as you can. At 35, I obtained a Masters in Library and Information Science (M.S.) and have worked 12 years as a public service librarian.

Friends and I would go to double features, two or three times a week, to waste an afternoon (tickets cost about 40 cents). Those were the days long before video games and Vudu downloads.That why I’m proud to be introducing and moderating discussions about two films at NAMI’s National Convention in Seattle, June 27-30.The films are () and . For people who can’t attend the convention, both can be previewed online. Kings Park is also being screened on July 23 at the National Association of Social Workers Conference in Washington, D.C. It is becoming a vehicle for broad public education.(in Spanish with English subtitles) is a short film—about 15 minutes—based on the story of Juan Gabriel Velez Court , growing up in Puerto Rico, and his struggles with  (OCD). For NAMI, it also is a milestone—the first time that a Spanish-language film has been featured as a marquee event.is a powerful film. In 1967 at age 17, filmmaker, Lucy Winer was committed to Kings Park State Hospital in New York, after several suicide attempts. Established in 1885 and closed in 1996, the hospital had 9,000 patients at its peak—basically warehoused without humane treatment. Thirty years later, Lucy returned to the abandoned facility that had held her captive. Interviews in with other former patients, families and former hospital staff reveal both the painful legacy of state hospital systems from that era and the crisis that has resulted from . Instead of being warehoused, too many people with severe mental illness are living on the streets or without adequate support.For me, there are three intriguing moments in . One former hospital attendant fondly recalled that the hospital as a “paradise” because many of the staff lived in housing on its sprawling grounds, met their spouses there and raised their families in the shadow of its massive buildings. The private psychiatrist who committed Lucy acknowledged that Kings Park was a terrible solution, but there were few options at the time. The reason for Lucy’s committal was an imperative: she needed to be somewhere where she could be watched continuously, to keep her from killing herself. At the end of the film, Lucy seeks to reconcile conflicting emotions. She acknowledges that there were people at Kings Park who did help her, enabling her to find a path toward recovery.Looking to the future as well as the past, Kings Park provides astute historical perspective. Fifty years from now, will we condemn the present, while measuring progress with the same objectivity? I hope so.Editor’s note in which filmmaker Bud Clayman chronicles the illness that interrupted his career and the ups and downs of his path to recovery also be screened at NAMI’s convention.

    "title": "Gay Pride Month: Coming Out for Mental Health ",
    "description": " , Since the late 1980s, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender ()  youth of all ethnic groups have been “coming out or self-identifying at younger ages than earlier generations. Researchers believe that the average age of awareness of first attraction, whether a young person perceives his or her self as gay or heterosexual, occurs at around age 10.While there are a range of support services for LGBT youth,   have focused on the role or needs of families of LGBT adolescents, particularly families that are Spanish-speaking. As a consequence, families and caregivers have had little information or support to deal with sexual orientation and gender identity when young people come out during childhood and adolescence.This prompted and Dr. Rafael Diaz and myself to start the Family Acceptance Project (FAP) in 2002—the first research, education, family intervention and policy project to help ethnically and religiously diverse families support their LGBT children. FAP is affiliated with San Francisco State University. Our team has conducted the first in-depth research on what happens in Latino families when LGBT young people come out during adolescence.This research, conducted in English and Spanish with LGBT youth, young adults and families, identified more than 100 ways that families express acceptance and rejection of their LGBT children. This includes rejecting behaviors such as telling an adolescent that they shame the family or not letting the youth talk about their LGBT identity. It also includes accepting or supportive behaviors such as expressing affection, advocating for a gay or transgender youth when they are discriminated against by others or helping an LGBT youth get accurate information about their sexual orientation or gender identity.Our bilingual team studied how each of these family accepting and rejecting behaviors affect the health and mental health of LGBT young people. For the first time research shows that families and caregivers have a dramatic and compelling impact on their LGBT children’s physical health, mental health and well-being. It was found that LGBT young people whose parents and caregivers reject them report high rates of depression, substance abuse, suicide attempts and risk for HIV infection. It was also discovered that LGBT young people whose parents support them show much higher rates of self-esteem and greater well-being, with better overall health and lower rates of health and mental health problems.For example, LGBT teens that were highly rejected by their parents and caregivers were at very high risk for health and mental health problems when they become young adults (ages 21-25).Highly rejected young people were:Using this research, the FAP team has been working with Latino and other families with LGBT children for the past decade to develop a new family model to help families support their LGBT children. This new approach shows ethnically and religiously diverse families how to reduce their gay or transgender children’s risk for mental health problems and how to promote their well-being by engaging in supportive behaviors. By empowering Latino and other families with this new info, FAP has been able to show that parents and caregivers can learn to support their LGBT children once they learn how their reactions affect their LGBT children. This approach helps increase family support for young people with underlying mental health concerns.

    "description": "The Los Angeles TimesThank you so much for your article featuring Keris Myrick and her accomplishments in the face of mental illness.I have a son, age 23, who was diagnosed  with schizophrenic episodes and it has been one of the most difficult challenges of my role as parent. Since this is so new for me—he had a breakdown at college last November and has been hospitalized five times since then— my hope continues for him when I read articles like yours that feature someone who has dealt with the challenge and stigma of mental illness and has forged on to function very well, in my opinion, to lead a very productive life.My son has yet to come to terms with his illness, only recognizing that he sometimes gets depressed and because of his  approach to life and natural eating, doesn't like to take the medications prescribed. I have become very familiar with NAMI and have taken their  course, which I highly recommend, to help me be more educated and understanding of its effects on those who live with mental illness.I want to praise you and  for featuring articles like this to help with the stigma and education on the subject. I think that this article, with the works of other groups like NAMI and actresses like Glenn Close and her work with , only help bring attention to one of the most devastating illnesses to strike families.I am one most grateful parent and NAMI activist. I'm currently trying to step up to the plate as I have become a Team Captain for our local NAMI Walk to help the cause.Blessings to you and a big THANK YOU!!! Cindie Bassett, L.M.T.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Speaking Out: A Cheesy Stigma Story ",
    "description": "Who would have ever thought that French cheese would stigmatize people living with mental illness?Last week , the multinational cheese maker headquartered in Paris,  from the French mental health community over a small toy inkpad that was being given away in packages of Mini Babybel, a small round cheese coated in red wax.The company’s U.S. subsidiary is Bel Brands USA, which produces  cheese as well as Mini Babybel.The inkpads featured the term “des vacances de malade mental” (mentally ill holidays), apparently a play on words which the company claimed was intended to mean “extraordinary.” In English or French, I think something was lost in the translation.The company has apologized and promised to meet next month with leaders of French disability organizations to talk about ways to fight discrimination—after everyone returns from vacation, I’m sure.The story caught my eye for several reasons.One, it’s good to keep in mind that the stigma that surrounds mental illness is not limited to the United States. It exists in popular cultures throughout the world. The challenge to overcome it is immense, but at least we are not alone.The story also demonstrates two basic tactical approaches used in fighting stigma.The first is protest. The second is dialogue--with the ideal hope being that dialogue can turn into partnership.Traditionally, movies and television have lead the pack in spreading stigma, but retail products and advertising also have an impact.Boycotts rarely work per se, but protests in general pack a punch. (With boycotts, you need to mobilize huge numbers of people over a long period of time and make a major financial dent).No one likes bad publicity. That’s one reason why companies monitor social media carefully and, believe it or not, actually read customer comments submitted through their websites.In the era of social media, individuals have more power than they realize.Every little bit helps.If you see or hear an offensive television or radio , go to the company’s website and Facebook page and let them know. Share your concerns on  page and those of other mental health organizations.Let the public debate begin.(Did you watch the commercial linked in above? What did you think?)Protest may not actually change attitudes. They may only result in a “Gee whiz, we didn’t intend to hurt anyone’s feelings” type apology. Sometimes, there will be no response at all. However, protest may change behavior, quietly, behind the scenes. No business wants to “get into trouble” a second time, if only because it’s too much a headache.Protest causes people to take notice.It can lead to dialogue and the best outcome of all is a partnership that emerges out of controversy. Be strong in protest when it’s warranted, but always stay committed to finding common ground.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "The Colorado Tragedy: Mental Health System Concerns ",
    "description": "Last week, I offered  on the recent Colorado tragedy in which 12 people died and 58 others were wounded.At that time, public inquiry had started to focus on whether or not the person responsible for the tragedy had ever sought help for mental illness or whether anyone or any institution had encouraged or required him to be evaluated.This week,   that in years past his mother sought counseling for him—because of his social isolation. Court filings then revealed he was seeing a psychiatrist at the University of Colorado prior to the July 20 attack.Public discussion initially focused on the wide availability of guns in our society. It has now shifted to the question of whether or not the mental health care system failed leading up to the tragedy. It is an issue addressed eloquently in  by Pete Earley in a , “Massacres No Excuse to Stigmatize the Mentally Ill.”There are many causes of violence in society. As reported by the  “the overall contribution of mental disorders to the total level of violence in society is exceptionally small.”When exceptions occur, they are often a sign that something has gone terribly wrong in the mental health care system—which as Pete warns, we ignore “at our own peril.” In specific cases, public authorities or the news media need to inquire:These questions can help inform specific cases, but they are still only part of a much bigger picture.Frankly, the nation’s mental health care system is not geared to accurate diagnosis or treatment of early-onset mental illness—assuming that a person has access to treatment at all. It doesn’t matter whether a university counseling center or community mental health clinic is involved. The system is fragmented and grossly inadequate. The chasm between need and care is devastating for persons living with mental illness and their loved ones. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention () has found that about half of adults in America will develop a mental illness during their lifetime. One in four adults experiences a mental disorder in any given year, and one in seventeen lives with a serious mental illness like schizophrenia, major depression or bipolar disorder. Yet a new report from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  has indicated that only 40 percent of adults with serious mental illness receive any treatment.When it comes to treatment, one size does not fit all; it often depends on the severity of the condition. Treatment  along a “continuum of care” may need to include medication, psychosocial therapy, housing supports or a combination. To find a treatment provider, a person’s family doctor often is the starting point, but individuals and families then have to contend with confusing referrals or networking among different .For psychiatric crises, hospital emergency rooms may be a default point of admission, but only if individuals consent to treatment—or are judged to be a danger to themselves or others, regardless of other symptoms that may be apparent. Even then, treatment assumes availability of hospital beds.\r\n\r\nAt a time when mental health care is needed now more than ever, however, many states are cutting  inpatient beds and community services. In 2009, NAMI published  a report on state mental health care systems. The national average was D, based on 65 specific criteria. Since then, conditions have worsened.In 2011, NAMI published a report on  showing a deepening crisis.Increasingly, emergency rooms, homeless shelters and jails are struggling with the effects of people falling through the cracks—due to lack of mental health services and supports.No matter what facts ultimately emerge from the Colorado tragedy, Americans need to focus on the fact that the mental healthcare system is already in crisis.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "Along with so many other Americans, NAMI members have been saddened by the tragedy in Aurora, Colo. in which 12 people were slain and 58 wounded in a theater at the premiere of a Batman movie.NAMI does not speculate about  or other factors that may be involved in such tragedies—or for that matter other kinds of news events. No one should diagnose through the news media.Despite many public perceptions, we do know that generally the likelihood of violence from people with mental illness is low. In fact, the  has reported that “the overall contribution of mental disorders to the total level of violence in society is exceptionally small.” There are many reasons why violence occurs in our society, many of which have nothing or little to do with mental illness.On the other hand, violence sometimes occurs. In some cases, it is because something has gone wrong with the mental health care system. At this time, that does not seem to be the case.Recognizing that there is a problem is always the first step. Right now, public inquiry is focused on whether or not the behavior of the person responsible for the tragedy ever caused anyone or any institution to encourage or require him to be evaluatedThe Surgeon General has acknowledged that the risk of violence among individuals with mental illness increases to some degree in the case of substance abuse or , a symptom which typically involves a “break with reality” through paranoia, hallucinations or delusions. Social withdrawal may precede such breaks. Early warning signs of psychosis, particularly in the year leading up to the break, may include:Young adults in their 20s are the most common age group to experience the first onset of psychosis. This is a stage of life that usually challenges young people to develop more independence, establish an identity, create intimate relationships and move away from home. Immediate family members, who usually are most aware of changes in behavior of a loved one, play a less central role at this time, particularly if a person has moved to another city or state, such as to attend college or graduate school.Many people recover from a first episode of psychosis and never experience another one. The first step, however, is always recognizing onset of the illness and getting treatment.Again, one cannot diagnose based on media reports. Risks of violence among people with mental illness are low overall. It is important not to perpetuate stigmatizing stereotypes. However, NAMI has been asked by the news media and many concerned families over the last few days about warning signs and what to do.Regardless of whether or not violence is a concern and regardless of what the case may turn out to be in the Aurora tragedy, the first step is to recognize warning signs of illness and to reach out to a person who may be in trouble. Help them get help.For more information about mental illness, treatment and recovery, please browse this website or call the NAMI HelpLine at (800) 950-NAMI (6264).We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "Last week, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition led by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino unveiled an interactive map to accompany its 2011 report,  The coalition has been working to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous or potentially dangerous individuals, but the map focuses specifically on state reporting of mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).The 2011 report and map provide informative data and some helpful perspective, but the focus and tone, particularly the report introduction, has grossly stigmatized individuals living with mental illness. It has blurred public dialogue and reinforced the erroneous perception that all people with mental illness are inherently violent.The U.S. Surgeon General has determined that the likelihood of violence from people with mental illness is low. There are many reasons why violence occurs in our society, many of which have nothing or little to do with mental illness.In contrast to the mayors’ report, National Public Radio last week broadcast a  on “The Law—and the Reality—of Gun Access.”  currently bars certain categories of individuals—including  with a history of mental illness—from purchasing or owning guns. Potential purchasers are screened through the NICS.The mayors’ report is correct in identifying holes in the system but in its call on the federal government to provide clear guidance as to “which mental health and drug abuse should be submitted to NICS,” falls woefully short of addressing one of the most important factors responsible for confusion among the states.Federal law speaks in terms of individuals “adjudicated mentally defective” a term that is not only highly offensive, but has no practical meaning. Likewise, terms in the law such as “civilly committed” require practical definition.In 2007, NAMI  before Congress, explaining how current definitions in the law are vague, leading to holes in compliance and enforcement. To date, there has been no effort in Congress to change the law—thoughtfully and carefully—in a way that is not only overly broad, but also avoids unfair, damaging discrimination.One paramount concern is to avoid creating a situation where people are in fact discouraged from getting help when they need it because of speculative fear over stigma.It’s worth having public dialogue about making gun laws more effective. But extreme, broad-brushed rhetoric that ignores medical science, modern definitions and actual risk factors will only detract from the discussion.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "Last month I celebrated my 16th anniversary of moving to the United States. I have now lived almost half of my life here.I still remember the day I came to this country. In one day of travel I went from Quito, Ecuador to Kirksville, Mo. I went from living in a city of more than a million people to a rural town of 15,000 and from 9,000 feet above sea level to 965 feet.I was 17 years old. I had just graduated from high school and I could not wait to start my college experience. To be honest, I never thought I would stay here beyond my college years. But here I am.I am one of the more than 50 million  who live in this country. My story is just one of the many of people who have come to the United States from all over Latin America. We have come for many different reasons: fleeing wars and revolutions, seeking better economic opportunities, to advance our education and looking for a better future for our families.Do these reasons sound familiar?Like many who came before us—Germans, Irish, Italians and others—Latinos have come looking for the American Dream. In the process we have enriched and strengthened America through our backgrounds and our experiences. The road that brought as here may be different in some ways, but at the end, we have all come to love and become part of this great nation.We share the same challenges as others—and in some cases additional ones. Mental illness is no exception. Latinos have similar rates of mental illness as the nation’s overall population. However, we face . Many studies underscore significant disparities in access and quality of mental health treatment.Latinos, no matter their socio-economic status, receive some of the worst mental health care in our society. Imagine for a moment the bad, broken and convoluted mental health system that your own families have navigated. Now imagine it being much, much worst. That’s what my community faces.This is one of the reason Latinos have joined NAMI: to help change this unacceptable reality. We have joined NAMI to help our community and to provide others the help and support they need to recover. We have joined NAMI to advocate for equality in access and quality of care and to improve care for everyone. Will you join us too?Thankfully NAMI has created many resources both for  and people working to engage our community. Our common experiences give us common cause.

    "description": "When I had my baby boy six months ago I had no idea I was about to experience the most terrifying time in my life. It was a mental health crisis.When my baby was 4 months old I began to feel scared all the time. I kept my kids inside all the time because I was afraid of what could happen while we were out. The fear then began to escalate to terror very quickly! I took it out on my 3 year old by irrationally screaming at him all the time.When I thought things couldn’t possibly get any worse, I had my first panic attack in the middle of a family dinner. My hands were shaking, my heart was racing, and I really thought I was about to die. This is when I knew I needed to get help.It took me a miserable week full of panic attacks to get up the courage to call my doctor, but when I finally got in to see her she frightened me even more. She told me that I probably didn’t have postpartum anxiety or  because my baby was already 4 months old.That same night I really began to lose it, panicking to the point of rushing off to the emergency room (ER) fearing that something was really wrong with me. The ER doctor told me that I had postpartum  for sure and that it was possible to get it up to a year after you have your baby. After being prescribed Zoloft and being sent home I felt relieved to finally know what was happening to me, but that relief didn’t last long.I spent that weekend making numerous trips to the ER with thoughts of suicide and the concern that I might hurt my kids. It was terrifying because I had never in my life had thoughts like this before. I was analyzed over and over again by mental health professionals and, by the end of the weekend, was begging them to take me to a psychiatric unit. They refused, stating that I wasn’t “psychiatric material.” The ER doctor determined that the Zoloft was not working for me and told me to make an appointment with my doctor on Monday.After explaining my ordeal to my doctor that Monday he elected to put me on Celexa and Ativan. Within hours I was feeling slightly better. From then on my condition has been steadily improving and I have been seeing a mental health counselor and a therapist regularly.Now that I have come out of the darkness I am angry at how little help there is for women going through this. My sister and I created an online support group on Facebook called “Postpartum Anxiety Support Group.” If you are a woman and feel like you may be experiencing postpartum anxiety or depression, I urge you to .

    "description": "My name is Jessica Lynn Gimeno and I am from Des Plaines, Ill. I come from a large Filipino family where I’m blessed with an endless parade of aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews. A typical gathering for Easter, someone’s birthday or “just-because” means that  thirty of us are present.  While I had a happy childhood, it was not without its hardships that came from racist experiences and an occasional “darkness” I could not put into words. When I was 5, I had a kindergarten teacher who asked the minority students to perform menial tasks like fetching her slippers. As the only student who would not comply, that woman hated me. In academics, my parents instilled in me a Trojan work ethic. My mom told me I had to work twice as hard as my friends to be taken seriously because of the color of my skin.  As a child, I faced dark moments when I questioned the meaning of everything in life. They were like flashes of grey in an otherwise cotton candy childhood. As I got older, moments of emptiness stretched into hours and in my teen years, I would feel sad for weeks at a time. And then I’d feel great for months until I inevitably felt bad again. I worked incredibly hard when I felt fine to compensate for times when I was too depressed to concentrate. When I was 18, a friend with bipolar disorder died by suicide. This prompted me to research the illness and I realized I had it too. I saw a doctor and got a second opinion, which all confirmed that I did indeed have . Getting a diagnosis finally brought freedom from years of sleepless nights and crying spells!For 10 years, I have been committed to medication and therapy. This, prayer and support from family and friends are responsible for my success. Despite fighting bipolar disorder and polycystic ovarian syndrome, I graduated  from Northwestern University with two majors. As a student, I co-founded a depression support network and spoke to hundreds of students about getting help. I also found 30 students psychiatric help and assisted them in finishing school. Sometimes I meet people who have a low opinion of people with mental illnesses, but their prejudice just motivates me to be a better advocate.In 2008, when I was 24 years old, I was diagnosed with a rare neuromuscular autoimmune disease called myasthenia gravis. I was given a 50-50 shot of living. Since I already beat depression, I knew I could fight this beast too. Today, I wake up in pain every morning because I have three physical illnesses. But every day I put on my “Rocky” boxing gloves and pray for strength.I work for a wonderful nonprofit, The Balanced Mind Foundation, which connects families whose children have mood disorders with mental health resources. I host , a weekly podcast & blog that helps teens & 20-somethings understand depression and bipolar disorder. Last year, in honor of National Minority Mental Health Awareness Month I did a series of interviews with people of different cultures called the “.” In recognition of my work, this year I won second prize in the National Council’s 2012 Awards of Excellence.If you’re a minority facing mental health stigma, here’s what I’ve learned: At the intersection of racism and stigma, there lies a funny thing called .We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Remembering Britni: One Step at a Time ",
    "description": "Thirty-two years old is too young to die.I am 32 years old, and I think so. My sister-in-law, Britni, died almost a year ago. She took her own life battling with mental illness. We are the same age. She left behind a husband and two beautiful children.Britni suffered and struggled for seven long years with . Nobody knew how much pain she really was in until it was too late.Britni had a very loving family with a husband, two kids, parents and three brothers. She was a happy, outgoing person who had lots of friends. She was popular in high school, participating in cheerleading and various other activities. She loved reading, camping with her family, antique shopping and going on walks.When I married her older brother, Britni and I became fast friends. I was glad to call her my sister. She was fun, silly and always made me laugh. She was the kind of person who was fun to hang around. She loved dressing up and always was the best-dressed, with the most matching accessories. She was a good aunt to my kids. They were guaranteed tons of fun and spoiling if she was around. They loved her like I did for the genuine love she showed all her family and friends.The painful part to talk about is when things got difficult for her and the family.When the symptoms of mental illness started, she would be in and out of psychiatric facilities, struggling with depression, self-mutilation and other symptoms of bipolar disorder. The family cried with her, took care of her children and prayed for her to receive the help and care she would need to feel better. She had a strong support system of family and friends around her that loved her and wanted her to succeed.She tried many different options of treatment, but ultimately took her life on July 9, 2011.After the funeral, I wanted to show Britni how much she meant to me. I wanted her to know that she had a sister that loved her. I felt a great need to do my part to raise awareness of mental illness.I set a goal to run the Surfside Beach, Texas marathon in memory of my sister-in-law this past February. I finished in first place for all women and eighth place overall. My marathon time was 3:26:52.1 (7:54 pace). I wore a grey ribbon on my running bib—a symbol of mental illness awareness.It was the hardest run I have ever completed. The marathon was 100 percent on the sand (not the easiest surface to run on!). The weather was rainy and stormy, and I was completely soaked to the bone! I felt added strength, because I was running for Britni. I knew that I had to finish the race for her.As our family has struggled with our loss, we have continued to educate ourselves about bipolar disorder. It is so important to share with my own children and others that it is okay to talk about this subject. This may help them find the assistance they need if or when they may need it.I am trying to increase my knowledge of mental illness, by learning the signs and coping skills for families and those diagnosed. I realize that I need to keep on doing this one step at a time.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "A Mother’s Message of Reconciliation and Restoration ",
    "description": "When mental illness strikes there is always collateral damage that extends beyond the person with the illness to include family and friends. Relationships are often strained to the limit as a person with mental illness struggles to cope with their symptoms and possibly refuses help and lack of resources and support can leave loved ones angry and burnt out. This creates a difficult situation that can result in more hurting than helping, and relationships can be damaged or lost.Sadly, the most strained relationship is often between a mother and child. Whether your mother has a mental illness or you are the mother of someone with a mental illness, you understand the heartache that exists when the relationship is damaged or lost. Fortunately, even the most difficult situations can be improved, and working towards reconciliation and restoration with your loved one well worth it.So, this Mother’s Day I encourage you to seek reconciliation with your mother or with your son or daughter. Hurtful words or regrettable actions can be forgiven; do not allow them to rob you of this relationship. Forgiveness is a gift to give and to receive. In many cases, it is the best Mother’s Day gift.Restoring a relationship that has been damaged by mental illness begins with the acceptance that the relationship will be different. Making adjustments that can restore and sustain the relationship, include:Realizing that you are not the cause nor do you have the cure for mental illness. Also, realize that you cannot provide all the care needed. Locate resources in your community. Day programs/club houses, , social services and case management provide social opportunities, support, and professional care that can greatly enrich lives, as well as, lighten the load.Education brings understanding, and understanding brings compassion. Contact your  for information about  and  education programs in your community.Remember to set and respect boundaries. Keep communication clear and concise. Revise your expectations. You should not expect everything or nothing from another individual, be realistic in your expectations.Renegotiate your emotional relationship. Mutual respect will provide equilibrium.Taking care of oneself is essential to having a strong and loving relationship. If you are ill, be willing to receive treatment and manage your illness by cooperating with your medical team and taking prescribed medication. If you are a caregiver, do not ignore your own needs. Providing ongoing, long term support requires you to be at your best.Statistics illustrate the enormous size and economic impact mental illness has on the United States, but they do not reflect the impact it has on our families. We do not have to allow mental illness to damage or destroy our relationships. Do not give up. Forgiveness works to reconcile and love to restore. I wish everyone a Happy Mother’s Day.Dawn Brown is a NAMI HelpLine Information and Referral Specialist and mother of six.

    "description": "ADHD Awareness Week, Oct. 14-20, is a time to take stock of what we know about attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is one of the most common mental health conditions in children. Although it is often thought of as primarily existing in children, much has been learned about its impact on teens and adults.NAMI invites you to visit the new resources prepared especially for ADHD Awareness Week as part of our , including tips on how to live well, chats with experts, personal stories from parents and podcasts.About nine percent of children and four percent of adults live with ADHD. It impacts school performance, work and relationships. Most of us from time to time experience distraction, may act impulsively and may struggle to pay attention. But that does not necessarily qualify for ADHD. It is when one or more of these symptoms significantly impact and disrupt school, work and/or relationships that ADHD should be considered.More than half of all individuals with ADHD also have co-occurring conditions like anxiety, depression and substance use disorders.If you suspect that you or your child may have ADHD, here is what you can do:ADHD is most often treated with some combination of behavior therapy and medication. There is no one size fits all when it comes to treating ADHD. This is especially true when it co-occurs with other mental health conditions. It is important to find the right combination of treatments that work best for you or your child. Learning about ADHD is extremely important. Fortunately, there are plenty of helpful resources available from NAMI’s ADHD Resource Center for both children and adults. Visit the new section and listen to the podcast on , a growing field of professionals working to support and motivate youth and adults living with ADHD to improve school and work performance and other aspects of life.Check out the newly posted  of parents sharing tips on supporting your child and living well as an adult with ADHD. And don’t miss the podcasts on . The key to living well with ADHD is to find the services and supports that best address your unique needs. Exercise and healthy diet help to enhance your overall health and are a wonderful compliment to ADHD treatment.Many children and adults living with ADHD develop effective coping strategies that help reduce symptoms and increase overall quality of life.ADHD Awareness Week is the perfect time to recognize that we have come a long way and there is much support out there for all of those impacted by ADHD.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Why I Vote for Mental Health Care (and More) ",
    "description": "This is my first presidential election and I’m very excited to have a say about who is going to lead our country.I’m 21 years old, just graduated from college with a degree in psychology and I have been diagnosed with several mental illnesses, most recently . As a teen you feel like you don’t have a choice because parents and teachers decide everything for you. Finally, I get a chance help decide who is going to run the country. It’s also not just about who will run the country, but also what happens worldwide because the U.S. president has such a big influence internationally.When I was a child my parents made a point of taking me to the polls every election. I registered as a voter on my 18th birthday. I just filled out the application at school and popped it in the mail. It’s really easy—you can even fill it out on line, print and mail.When I went to vote for the first time, a few months after I turned 18, it was exhilarating to have a say. I was surprised that the line went so quickly, about 15 minutes and casting a ballot took maybe two minutes. I just pushed the buttons for the candidates I wanted to vote for and I was done. And the people at the polling place all clapped because I was a first time voter. I felt so proud.It’s really easy to find out which candidates align most with your views. There are websites all over the internet where you can research each candidate.On the  or  websites, all you need to do is put in your ZIP code and read candidate platforms. You can also read articles and blogs from their supporters and critics. If you want to find out what to say or questions to ask about mental health issues go to NAMI’s  website.The youth vote was influential in the 2008 election and also will have an impact in 2012. Candidates who are elected in 2012 will have a say on issues young people are concerned with, like gay rights, education, abortion and health services.The 2012 election is important for young voters who care about mental healthbecause we are still in a recession and services need funding. Many people don’t realize how greatly mental health services affect the well-being of our entire nation. If we can help people with  through peer support groups, hospitalization, medication and community services, not only do we help individuals, but then they can go back to work and the whole community is stronger. When you are in your early 20s—in college or not—it can be a stressful time for people with emerging mental illness. We need service to stay in school and go on to be part of running the country.Health care reform affects young voters because the Affordable Care Act currently allows people age 26 and under to stay on their parents’ health insurance. If that were repealed, young Americans will have to find their own health care, which is becoming more and more expensive. Without insurance young people with mental illness would not be able to find a doctor or pay for medication. There would be more hospitalizations the person could not pay for, which would also be a drain on the economy.Casting an informed vote is really simple, especially with the internet and the technology we have now. It’s not hard to reach the candidates. By writing to them you are helping influence and create a country that is run the way the people want it to be.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Health Care Reform, the Supreme Court and Implications for People Living with Mental Illness ",
    "description": "This week, the U.S. Supreme Court is hearing arguments on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the health care reform law enacted in 2010. The case has engendered strong reactions among Americans, with some fervently arguing that the new law should be upheld, others arguing equally fervently that the law is unconstitutional and should be repealed. Sifting aside for the moment political arguments for and against the ACA, there are two main issues before the Court.First, is the provision in the law requiring Americans to purchase health insurance (the “mandate”) an impermissible tax? Second, does the requirement in the law that all states participating in Medicaid must cover everyone at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) by 2014 exceed Congressional authority under the Constitution?Irrespective of how you feel about the overall law, the Supreme Court’s decision in this case has significant potential implications for people living with mental illnesses and their families.First, the expansion of Medicaid in 2014 to cover all individuals at or below 133 percent of the FPL will impact millions of Americans with mental illnesses who currently do not qualify for Medicaid for a variety of reasons, including pending SSI applications, lack of a fixed address, or those with part time employment whose income may exceed current Medicaid eligibility levels.Second, many individuals living with mental illnesses will be included among those able to purchase federally subsidized health insurance policies in 2014 through state health insurance exchanges established by the ACA. And, these policies must cover mental health and substance abuse treatment at parity with other medical conditions.Third, if the entire ACA were struck down this would negate important provisions in the law expanding federal mental health and substance abuse parity to millions of Americans currently not protected by the law, including those who purchase health insurance through state insurance exchanges and those who are added to Medicaid through the expansion.Finally, if the Supreme Court were to strike down the requirement in the ACA that all uninsured Americans purchase health insurance, it is not clear at present whether the ruling would negate the entire law or just the operation of the health insurance exchanges. If the entire law were to be negated, this would eliminate other aspects of the ACA beneficial to individuals living with serious mental illnesses.For example, the nullification of the ACA would eliminate the provision in the law establishing a Medicaid Health Home option for integrating health and specialty care for individuals with chronic disabilities. A number of states are currently moving aggressively to implement these health homes. The nullification of the entire ACA would also eliminate important insurance reforms, such as the requirement that all individuals be issued insurance regardless of pre-existing conditions.  And, it would eliminate provisions designed to fix problems in the Medicare Part D program, such as subsidies for those who reach the so-called “Donut Hole.”Clearly, much is at stake for individuals living with serious mental illnesses and their families. The Supreme Court is expected to issue its decision in June.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Making a Difference with Just a Phone Call ",
    "description": "This spring, after several of my close friends and family reached out to share the news that Mike Wallace, the legendary investigative journalist and “60 Minutes” anchor, had died, I sat down and had a good cry as if I had lost a favorite uncle. I know that it probably sounds strange that I was so personally affected by the passing of a famous newsman whose life was seemingly very different and removed from mine, but the fact is that Mike Wallace played a significant role in life and my decision to pursue a career in public health.Let me try to explain. In remembering Mr. Wallace, his colleagues at CBS News illustrated his reputation as a fierce interrogator noting that among the most dreaded phrases one might ever hear was, “Mike Wallace is here to see you.” Well, for me, that actually couldn’t be further from the truth.In 1996, after purposefully stopping the medication that I knew had helped me, I was in the middle of my third—and thankfully last—major struggle with severe and debilitating depression. I had gone to spend the day at my parents’ house where I could basically hide out and not have to keep up the façade of being “OK.” From my cocoon of misery on the sofa, I heard the phone ring, mom answered, said something typically Southern to the caller like, “Well bless your heart!” and then, “Helen, Mike Wallace is on the phone for you.” Those words turned out to be a lifeline and one of the best gifts I have ever been given.It seems that my mother had seen  speaking out about his recovery from depression on Larry King and had written a letter to him describing my struggle. Though I would never have imagined it when I was younger watching with my dad as Mr. Wallace went “toe-to-toe” with powerful world leaders, business tycoons and cultural icons on Sunday night television; Mike Wallace and I had a very real connection. We had both experienced the desolation and sheer terror of living with major depression. The connection was strong enough to move Mr. Wallace to pick up his phone in Manhattan and reach out to this young woman in Commerce, Ga. whom he had never met.I will never forget that when I answered he said, “Helen, this is Mike Wallace. Your mother wrote and told me what you are going through. I have been there myself, and it is hell. Now, why won’t you take your medication?” I said that I hated the idea that I was “damaged goods” who had to take medicine every day just to be “normal.” He acknowledged his own deep sense of shame and helpless ness in the throws depression and went on to explain that he had always been someone who refused to even take an aspirin for a headache, but that he would be taking his antidepressant every day for the rest of his life and be grateful that the treatment existed. Comparing notes on shame and helplessness with Mike Wallace was an almost surreal experience on one hand. On the other hand, it was a very human and comforting connection that really did change my life.Trying to explain the anguish of depression to someone who has not lived it themselves is almost impossible. Though the exact nature and quality of the pain is unique for everyone, as a survivor, when you meet or talk with another person who has been through depression with a capital “D,” you both know immediately that the other person understands your harrowing journey firsthand.By the time Mr. Wallace and I spoke on the phone that day, I had already survived two bouts of . Honestly, I guess I had really known things were not ‘OK” since I was 8 or 9 years old but it wasn’t until I was off at college attempting to fumble my way into adulthood with the rest of the first year students at the University of Virginia that depression hit with its full force. Without the benefit of a familiar routine and established support system, I couldn’t escape the irrational yet overwhelming worries, sadness, guilt and sense of worthlessness. I knew I needed help—serious help—and told my parents over winter break that I couldn’t return to school. “Bottoming out” like that at a time when most of my friends and peers were enjoying new found freedoms and blossoming into their own was excruciatingly painful.As painful as it was, I can honestly say that when I look back on my experience with depression, the overriding feeling that I have is gratitude. I was truly one of the very lucky ones. I know very well that things could have turned out quite differently, even tragically, for me without the support and connections that I had. I felt safe enough with my family to let them know that I needed help, they had the resources to access competent treatment and I was surrounded by people who were willing to reach out and let me know they cared, even if they didn’t really understand what was going on with me. This is a rare combination, and a case of sheer good fortune and circumstances that I will never take for granted.Even so, it was still a rough slow climb up out of the abyss. Through therapy and medication, I got well and got on with my life. But the shame of having a mental illness and needing medication dogged me and caused me at points in my life, as I mentioned earlier, to stop taking my medication. Each time I did this, I slowly slid right back down into a severe depression. It was during the last of those crashes that my mother had written to Mike Wallace.While medication and therapy had helped me get well during each of these episodes, it was the phone call from Mike Wallace that finally put me on the road to true recovery and healing. For that I will be forever grateful. After talking with him, I began to see myself through a new lens. Rather than a weakly failure, I gradually developed a real sense of self-respect as a survivor, a fighter, waging a life and death struggle with something powerful enough to move someone like Mike Wallace, who was willing to discard any reservations he might have had about tarnishing his professional image, and who reached out to share his own pain. He shared it not only with me personally, but with the world, through many interviews and public appearances to support access to mental health treatment, research, and to provide others with encouragement and hope for recovery. After talking with him, not only did I start taking my medication again, I started to make a real effort to acknowledge the gifts and strengths that I had been given and to recognize and share my own story without shame when I thought it might be helpful to someone.That gets me back to why I chose public health. There is so much pain in the world; there is pain from disease, violence, social inequalities and injustices, and there are no quick fixes or easy answers. Though enormous to me at the time, I realize that my pain was just an infinitesimally small piece of that larger pain. Each and everyone of us wants safety, security and contentment for ourselves and for those we love, but these things are not a given for anyone…no matter what neighborhood you live in, what school you go to or even what good works you do. We all have to work hard and continuously to create and maintain the conditions that make hope and security, even in the face of adversity, a real possibility for everyone.I chose a career in public health because it allows me the opportunity to do some of that work. There is strong research that shows that building connectedness at the individual, family, community and societal level and encouraging safe, secure, nurturing relationships is protective against violence, suicide and child maltreatment particularly.The types of connections and relationships that are most important include things like regular social contact, strong family attachments, involvement in community activities, access to services, and communication among helping organizations (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012). On an individual level, it is exactly these types of connections and relationships that led to that phone call from Mike Wallace that gave me back my life. (He actually called me back about six months later to check on me and see how I was doing—amazing!)Public health, in all its various forms, is not easy work – attempting to understand patterns of disease and behavior, identifying risk and protective factors, developing and testing prevention programs as well as building bridges between the research and practice worlds can be daunting and, frankly, sometimes feels esoteric and quite removed from the impact that we are all so eager to see. However, it is my lived experience that there is real power in the connections we are trying to develop. If we can encourage and sustain these connections at the population level, I believe we really do have chance to prevent suffering.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Book Review: 8 Keys to End Bullying Strategies for Parents & Schools",
    "description": "By Signe WhitsonW.W. Norton & Company (2014)For parents and school personnel, dealing with acts of bullying can be a rocky road. Signe Whitson’s book  is a helpful guide on how to handle these types of situations. In her book, Whitson carefully breaks down bullying into eight parts.She starts off by defining bullying, which can be mistaken for rudeness, or brushed off as something minor, by adults. Bullying is something that adults should not simply overlook. It is best for the child’s well-being if adults intervene and stop bullying.Although I am neither a parent nor a teacher, I am the eldest of five. From a young age both of my sisters experienced bullying. My youngest brother is a special needs child entering kindergarten and I worry that he may be bullied as well. Whitson lists children who are likely to be bullied, children with disabilities being among them. This list helps raise awareness of children vulnerable to bullying, alerting parents to keep an eye out for them.Children today spend several hours a day with technology. For many young people technology has become an essential part of life. Being constantly connected makes cyberbullying even more possible.  focuses on ways parents can keep up with children’s technology use and how to get children to be open about it.While many children spend hours plugged in to their various electronics, Whitson suggests that children should spend more time face-to-face. With the right guidance, more social interaction enables children to develop social and emotional skills, and Whitson discusses programs and resources that can help develop these skills. These programs teach youth emotion management, empathy, problem solving, assertiveness, and friendship-building.Instead of punishing and humiliating children who bully, teaching these skills can help prevent bullying in the first place and help raise empathy levels.  These social and emotional programs can also help reduce bullying bystanders. Some children don’t know how to intervene when they witness an incident of bullying. Whitson points out that being assertive is key to stopping bullying.Whitson makes it clear that from school polices, to house values, to a relationship with a child, adults can have a great influence on bullying prevention. Also through engaging activities and assertiveness, children themselves can make a difference in the campaign to end bullying.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

A colleague of mine told me her kids said to her last night, “Mrs. Doubtfire is dead.” They were crushed by this news which seemed so unbelievable based on their experience of the character. He was a figure that transcended generations. It was a very sad day for many, and my heart goes out to his family, who will bear the incredible pain of his death long after the news cycle ends.I recalled that he had a history of struggles, but I was still shocked to hear that he had died by suicide. He was a genius and had many supports. But of course  doesn’t calculate those things. Severe depression distorts rational thinking and can lead to the fixed idea that hopelessness and pain are to be your experience forever. I have heard this from patients who have lived after suicide attempts. They told me they had lost all perspective and simply wanted to end their pain. They often reported simply losing a sense that they mattered to other people and forgot that they too were loved.Depression distorts reality and causes a risk of death. It is a persistent and serious public health crisis that doesn’t get enough coverage. It can happen to anyone and is associated with a great deal of the suicides in our country. When combined with a  disorder it becomes even riskier and harder to treat, and when it is part of a  it requires extra attention. Other public health problems like heart disease have seen great results in the past several decades—we cannot say the same about .What can we do about this public health crisis that takes so many from us?Chances are someone you know is struggling with depression, and this is a simple way that can make a difference.Rest in Peace Robin.

    "title": " Why Screening for Diabetes is Important (Especially if You Take Psychiatric Medications)",
    "description": "Today is the , its annual day to promote screening for diabetes. Diabetes is a serious health condition that reminds me of many psychiatric illnesses—it is serious, has substantial risks and requires attention. Diabetes is also like serious psychiatric disorders in that daily choices can make a difference to improve outcomes. For diabetes, an exercise program can improve or in some cases reverse the development of diabetes. (Exercise can also be  for mental health conditions).There is another connection: many people with psychiatric illnesses are at increased risk of diabetes and the medications used to treat those conditions often confer additional risk. These risks should be weighed against the benefits of these medications, which can also be significant. The most common mechanism of the increased risk is weight gain, which is the underlying cause of most of the rise in adult onset diabetes. Many psychiatric medications can lead to an increase in weight, which in turn raises the risk of diabetes. Second generation antipsychotics can be a particular concern in this area, but they do not all bring the same risk. For more information on the risks associated with many of these medicines, see NAMI’s information on .Another piece of the puzzle is that the research literature shows that individuals living with mental illness do not get screened adequately. This could be caused by many things, including inadequate care. NAMI members have helped to change many aspects of the health care world, and by advocating for screening we can help primary care doctors approach the problem. If you cannot join in the , ask for a screening at your next appointment. It is a simple blood test. It could be lifesaving, especially if you are in one of the ADA risk categories or are taking psychiatric medications.Also, take a look at the  of the implications of diabetes for people living with a serious mental illness that was published in fall 2013 for more information on the relationship between diabetes and mental illness.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

In other cases, stores sell “mental patient” costumes with straitjackets. They perpetuate stigmatizing, offensive stereotypes of people living with mental illness.Don’t get me wrong, NAMI loves Halloween as much as anyone else. But would anyone sponsor an attraction based on a cancer ward? Take middle school kids on a field trip to see one? Promote one based on offensive racial or ethnic stereotypes?The U.S. Surgeon General has identified stigma as a major barrier to people in reaching out for mental health care when they need it. People struggling with mental illness also often internalize it, impeding recovery.In 2010, NAMI Ohio led a protest of a major amusement park's special Halloween attraction “Dr. D. Mented's Asylum for the Criminally Insane.” It provided an important “teaching moment” in the news media and dialogue with the park, which to its credit,  to change the name and theme of the attraction for future years.Here are just a few targets for protest this year.

    "description": "By Gayathri RamprasadHazelden (2014)Growing up in Bangalore, India, Gayathri Ramprasad’s life is highlighted by doting relatives and the traditions of Hinduism. Her father’s goal is for her to move to the United States in the hope of a better future. This classic immigration tale takes on a twist when Ramprasad experiences her first bout of depression in her late teens. Despite repeated trips to physicians, no one recognizes the signs of panic and anxiety disorder and depression. Her father repeatedly tells her to “snap out of it.” Her mother resorts to prayer. In a culture where family reputation is all, and expression of emotional pain is taboo, mental illness is seen as a personal failing, a curse by the evil eye or possession.Mental health treatment was and continues to be a rarity in India: a 2012 study done by the Royal College of Psychiatrists in London indicates that there is only one psychiatrist for every 200,000 people.Still, Ramprasad does what she can to live day-to-day, managing to graduate from college and enter a successful arranged marriage. She follows her husband to Portland, Ore., and does her best to play the role of a devoted, traditional wife and eventual mother. She is happier than she’s been in years, and believes she has achieved the family dream. But after the birth of her first child, her depression comes crashing back in the form of post-partum. During a visit to India, Ramprasad experiences a suicidal breakdown, and is finally diagnosed. Unfortunately, this does little good in relieving her fears and disappointment that she has failed her family.Upon returning to America, she is hospitalized after attempting to bury herself alive in her backyard. She begins to educate herself about depression and anxiety, and eventually begins to learn how to heal. Her illness proves to be drug-resistant, with minor doses intensifying her despair and suicidal thoughts. After decades of trying various antidepressants, her doctor suggests she try a regime of cognitive behavioral therapy, exercise and holistic methods. Ramprasad is not without a sense of irony: “Although I was born and raised in India where pranayama, transcendental meditation and yoga originated, it is ironic that I needed to travel across the world, and nearly lose my sanity and life, before American teachers taught me these skills, the practice of which has transformed my life.”Having finally found a course of treatment that worked, Ramprasad turned her sights to becoming an advocate. In 2002, she discovered NAMI, and helped organize the first  pilot event. She then began collaborating with NAMI on a regular basis, and telling her own story at talks around the country. In 2006, she founded ASHA International, a non-profit organization dedicated to educating the public about mental illness on an international level. To this day, Ramprasad continues her work as an advocate, emphasizing the need for cultural sensitivity to better reach communities around the world.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

You can also get crisis text support via the Crisis Text Line by .Bullying is never okay.It is not just kids being kids. It is not simply part of growing up. It is harmful and destructive and a major challenge to mental health.That’s why the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education are sponsoring a special website  offering resources to support initiatives to end bullying in schools and other communities.Between now and Oct. 14, the federal partners are  ages 13 to 18 to create 30- and 60-second public service announcements. Video submissions need to showcase ways that young people are taking action against bullying and promoting kindness and respect. Three winning videos will be featured on the stopbullying.gov website. The grand prize winner will receive $2,000 and two other honorable mention videos will each receive $500.What exactly is bullying?Bullying is unwanted and aggressive behavior that happens repeatedly and involves a real or perceived imbalance of power. The power imbalance usually involves someone using physical strength, greater popularity or embarrassing or humiliating information to control or harm another person.Bullying can take many forms. It can be done with words, including repeated teasing, name-calling, threats and inappropriate sexual comments. It can be done through social interactions—repeatedly and intentionally excluding someone from a group, telling other kids not to be friends with someone or spreading rumors and embarrassing a targeted person in public. It can also be done by hurting another person physically or vandalizing possessions.Bullying can take place in school, on the bus, in neighborhoods and, increasingly on electronic devices. Cyber bullying on the Internet gives some youth a sense of security because they are able to hide behind a computer screen. Because most kids now communicate with peers primarily through cell phones and computers, bullying messages, photos and other information can quickly “go viral” throughout the Internet.Bullies target peers whom they often see as different, alone or in some way weak. In the long run, bullying not only hurts those who are bullied, but also those who witness it and the bullies themselves. It can destroy self-esteem and damage their ability to function in adulthood.What can be done about it? Parents and caregivers can talk with their kids about bullying so that they understand it and recognize that it is not okay. They can give their kids advice about what to do if they are bullied or if they see someone else being bullied. Here are some things to share with kids:In safe circumstances, standing up or speaking out against bullying behavior when it occurs can rob the bully of much of his/her power.Bullying should never be ignored. More than 20 percent of high school students report being bullied in any given year.

But will they? NAMI created a brief online  to answer this very question. We need your help to find out how recent changes in federal law affect you and your family.Over 11 million people with mental illness were uninsured as of 2010. Most are now eligible for mental health and substance use care because of  under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA requires Medicaid expansion and individual and small group private health plans to cover mental health and substance use services as one of the . This change will mean that millions of people will be getting access to private health coverage or Medicaid for the first time.Even more changes to mental health and substance use coverage came July 1. Provisions to the  were put in place to ensure parity for mental health and substance use care. But what exactly is parity? Parity ensures that all plans cover mental health and substance use treatment on par with other types of care. That means fair and equal terms for what types of services are covered, the procedures necessary to get care and how much you pay out of pocket.Because these changes are so important, NAMI wants to understand how the ACA and the new parity rules affect you and your ability to get the care you need. We created the  to learn from you.We want to hear from everyone in need of mental health or substance use care. So if you or your family member uses these services, ! It doesn’t matter if you have private health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, VA health benefits, student health, any other type of coverage or don’t have coverage at all.Take this  on behalf of you or your loved ones in need of mental health and/or substance use care. Spread the word to your friends, family, co-workers, and colleagues. It should only take 15-20 minutes. Post the link on your Facebook or Twitter!

    "title": "Building Awareness: Mental Illness’ Special Week ",
    "description": "Mental Illness Awareness Week is Oct. 7-13.This year’s theme is “Changing Attitudes, Changing Minds.”Every year, a truly grassroots mobilization occurs.What are you doing to observe it?In 1990, Congress proclaimed  as a means of increasing public understanding of , promoting  and helping to eliminate the stigma imposed on it.There are many other “awareness” months, weeks and days throughout the year for many causes. For the most part, national news media don’t pay attention to them, but local media do, because local events demonstrate direct community interest.Each year, NAMI Affiliates sponsor diverse activities in local communities: candlelight vigils, speakers in schools, film series, donations of books to libraries or special prayer readings in . Some submit op-ed articles to local newspapers or are interviewed on local television news as part of stories about treatment and recovery.Let’s also not forget  on Oct. 11, which NAMI has long supported.Because MIAW this year coincides with the election season, some Affiliates are including the non-partisan  in their plans.This year, NAMI also has  of public service announcements (PSAs) featuring images of Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill and Mahatma Gandhi, great leaders who each struggled with mental illness.Many  take place on weekends throughout the fall, providing a long reach for MIAW. There are 42 NAMI walks this fall alone.Other NAMIWalks took place in the spring around Mental Health Awareness Month. They are just as important, but some people do wonder about the distinction between MIAW and Mental Health Month.According to the , “mental health” and “mental illness” are points of reference on the same “continuum.” Mental health is not always easy to define: “wellness” is one definition, but mental health increasingly has been applied to include concerns over mental illness. Mental illness refers to diagnosable brain disorders characterized by changes in mood, thinking and behavior.“Mental health problems” may be less intense, but can lead to mental illness. One in four American adults experiences mental health problems in any given year. One in 17 lives with more severe conditions. MIAW focuses on the more severe point on the continuum where neglect and stigma often has been greatest—along with the need for public education. That’s why NAMI traditionally observes MIAW, as well as other opportunities to build awareness.So how can you participate?Let’s all work together to change attitudes and change lives.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "“Why Do Y’all Have Tattoos?” ",
    "description": "The  was an amazing, surreal experience. For four days, people from all over the country came together to educate and learn about mental illness. The entire conference was a smorgasbord of options, from panels on the latest updates in schizophrenia research to exhibits with titles like “Bipolar Girl Rules the World!” Yet, as fascinating as many of the lectures were, the thing that really intrigued me was the conversations people were having with each other. Ordinary people were coming together to communicate for many reasons: education, concern and curiosity.One of the most profound experiences I had was completely unexpected. I was looking at a booth on , when a man came up to me and started talking. He was there because his daughter has borderline and he wanted more information. I told him I had borderline and I’d be happy to answer any questions I could. He had one:\r\n\r\n“I don’t meant to be rude, but why do y’all have tattoos? I’m what you might call “old-school,” and I don’t really get them. My daughter has a bunch of them all over her. Is it a Borderline thing?”Very few things faze me, especially in regards to people asking questions about myself. They’ve run the gamut from polite to slightly tactless to downright insulting, and I’ve fielded them all as best I can. I should also mention that I have six tattoos, some of which are very visible when I wear a short-sleeved shirt. I listen to Goth and heavy metal music, and I wear a lot of black. I’m noticeably “different,” and I accept that people are going to have questions. But I never had anyone ask me if tattoos were “a borderline thing.” This was new, and somewhat refreshing. I liked this guy.He must have realized how awkward his phrasing was, because he started backpedaling. I just smiled and told him that people with tattoos get them for different, often personal reasons, and that the same applied to people with borderline who have tattoos. I told him a little bit about why I had them: that, for a long time, I lived in a body that gave me a great deal of suffering. This was my way of taking back control. Each tattoo symbolized a time and place in my life. I also explained that many people who have borderline self-harm, and that I saw this as a positive alternative. Perhaps his daughter did too.He smiled. “Yeah, you might be right. And considering what else she’s dealt with, tattoos aren’t so bad. It could be worse.”Our conversation switched to several other topics surrounding this notoriously maligned illness, but the initial question remained with me long after the conference was over.I shared with him how I had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder 12 years ago and was told I would never get better. How I was informed that there was no cure, and that I shouldn’t ask too many questions about my diagnosis, because then I would become “fixated.”Meeting other people with borderline wasn’t much better. I don’t know if it’s me, or the fact that this illness tends to emotionally cripple us to the point where we simply cannot interact with others because of the amount of psychic pain we’re in.But here was a guy who was not a doctor, not a therapist, not a person who had dated someone with borderline and written us off as “psychopaths,” but a father concerned for his daughter. A father who lived through the chaos that ruled over his child’s life, who couldn’t totally understand why she was the way she was, but who nevertheless knew it was an illness, not a character flaw. And who loved her anyway.When he looked at me, it was clear he didn’t see a lab specimen or an emotional leper, but a person who just so happened to have the same illness as his kid. The fact that she has tattoos or wore Edgar Allen Poe earrings? Feh. It could be worse.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": " Technology as a Tool for Recovery—A Promising Practice ",
    "description": "Millions of Americans face the day-to-day reality of living with a . Mental illness affects everyone—our communities, our families and ourselves. Access to help, treatment and services for those in need can be a challenge, and the impact of systems and treatment failures—homelessness, cycles of hospitalization, jail, failed relationships—affect many.And yet, amid the failures are stories of success. In many communities, we see innovative solutions emerging that offer hope while providing effective approaches that truly improve lives.Many people with mental illness do not have access to integrated primary health care. Despite the fact that people with mental illness often have other health challenges, including heart disease and diabetes, too often health care providers are not equipped to address all of their health care needs. And, if left untreated, this may result in additional struggles for the individuals, too often resulting in the use of other more expensive, downstream services including emergency departments and crisis services.In Massachusetts, one local approach to solving this challenge stands as a pillar, as a promising practice. Through the creative use of technology, community health care provider , along with Dartmouth Medical School and other community health providers, embarked on an effort to study the use of a small personal technology device, The Health Buddy, to help individuals manage their physical and mental health needs on a daily basis.“The Health Buddy helps me and my case manager stay connected,” said John, a gentleman with a mental illness who has been using the personal technology device to help him manage his mental and physical health care. “It helps monitor health and feeling and helps me manage my medications. It also helps me manage how to eat and when to eat to be healthier.”A small hand-held device with four buttons and a display screen, the Health Buddy, along with a related systems study, aims to teach individuals with serious mental illness, like John, how to help manage their chronic medical conditions and access care sooner while avoiding more severe complications.In John’s case, the technology helps him keep track of his health experiences and also alerts his treatment team. If he records information that alerts a concern, they are notified sooner and can reach out to check in to address any problems before they may escalate. If John needs something special, he can also alert his case management team ahead of time so they can talk about it, a relief to John who previously may have had to wait for an appointment to register an issue.“I think this technology is a good idea,” John shared. “I get to communicate every day, not just when I have an appointment. It serves as a reminder about my diabetes and mental health condition by asking me ‘How do you feel today?’ and then also gives me new information that is helpful for me in understanding how to be healthier.”In addition to helping John better manage his various health conditions, it has helped him stay connected, personally, and has helped him be more independent. He visits to the emergency department have rapidly decreased as he has learned to become his own health care advocate, and his relationships with his wife and sister have improved.“I think this is a good idea” John said. “Although it does not fix everything for me, I am walking more than I used to, I am more active and it has helped me get through my day better.” A promising practice indeed.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "A Groundbreaking Commitment to Psychiatric Research",
    "description": "Today I was fortunate to be on a panel to discuss the findings of a  published in Nature and the unprecedented  to further this type of work. The event was a celebration of Mr. Stanley’s game changing vision and commitment to research in the underlying biology of psychiatric illnesses, and a call to action for more progress in this crucial area. I represented the perspective of NAMI and our urgent need for better treatment options.The event was held at the Broad Institute in the heart of the MIT campus, which has become a hotbed of bioscience innovation and research. The Broad institute itself is bright and open, and conveys a sense of possibility. This was once a scruffy neighborhood and it was remarkable to experience the new energy flowing here. The Kendall Square area, at the center of the MIT campus, has been transformed by the influx of scientists and industry. This gift will continue to attract the best minds to continue the remarkable research momentum and help fill a critical need when funding from the U.S. government is uncertain.The study compared the genomes of more than 37,000 people living with  and compared their genes to people who do not live with the condition. The riddle that is the gene component to schizophrenia has vexed many but now the evidence base is rapidly expanding. Sorting out an enormous number of puzzle pieces and making patterns of them is the work of complex genetic assessment. The study identified 108 key genes (83 of which have not been previously linked to schizophrenia) in this analysis and the Broad Institute will do a deep dive of each of them. This study is only the first step; one of the lead scientists told me more papers are in press and will be coming out later this year.I have invited the lead scientists to our national convention in San Francisco in 2015 to share their insights to our community. Steve Hyman, the director of the Stanley Institute for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and former director of the NIMH has emphasized an open source philosophy. This means that all the data sets will be shared with researchers from across the world. This approach will clearly advance the field faster. This is an advance in scientific culture as well as neuroscience.In my work as a psychiatrist at the Prevention and Recovery from Early Psychosis (PREP) clinic I say “I don’t know” a great deal. My young patients and their families ask me, what caused these voices? How does the medication work exactly? Will reducing my medication after 3 years of no symptoms be a big risk to my recovery? For these and many other questions I offer my best understanding from the imperfect literature, and our theoretical understandings. For many of these questions we simply don’t have the building blocks we need. We simply need to learn more so better shared decisions can be made. My patients and families deserve better understanding to deal with symptoms that have so powerfully impacted their lives.Patience and humility are of course key themes in this kind of basic science research. The researchers are humbled to say that they cannot promise a quick return, yet carry clarity of purpose: cancer was once a scary and seemingly unknowable illness that has very few treatments. Today because of better knowledge of the underlying science, there are new options being developed on a regular basis in the field of oncology.  This gift and this culture change and this line of inquiry will hopefully yield similar results in our field.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "The Village: Opening Doors for Those in Need",
    "description": "High rates of homelessness and the revolving door of jails for many who live with serious mental illness are challenges many communities face. Nearly 25 percent have mental illness and an even higher percentage have substance abuse disorders. The Twin Towers Jail, part of the Los Angeles County jail system, is the world's largest jail, and the nation's largest mental health treatment facility.Recognizing that the lack of continuity of care was a huge barrier to helping those in most need,  (“the Village”) stepped to the plate in 1990 to offer a solution. This nationally-recognized program helps close the gap and encourage the reality of recovery through an approach that aims to provide consistent treatment. Key components of the program include:The Village is one of four exemplary programs heralded by , a partnership that aims to promote innovative community solutions to our national mental health crisis. The Village is especially recognized for the success in providing integrated health care for those who live with serious mental illness.Once homeless and struggling with drug addiction, Chrystal Arzola came to the program because she was “tired of being tired.” Encouraged by her sister, her first experience with the program was group housing which provided her a sober living environment and jumpstarted her recovery journey.”I came in angry, not able to get along with anyone. I wasn’t even aware of how I was part of the problem—living on the streets like I had been doing before I came to the Village, I became defensive, angry and ready to fight,” said Chrystal.The staff at the Village and the integrated program helped Chrystal learn how to control her anger. “They would hear me out. They really listened and did not push me. They understood, and through that, I began to understand, too,” Chrystal shared. “Now I know how to cope better, how to communicate. I have a job [as a staff member at the program facility], I am healthier and I go to church with my sister.”The Village aims to build a community by focusing intensely on each individual person. By providing coordinated care, including integrating mental and physical health needs, peer support, connections with the larger community, the Village helps each person gain independence and achieve wellness and meaning.Happier and healthier, Chrystal serves as a mentor to others at the program. “Now, I have my family back. The Village helped me learn how to better myself. I can actually say that now, I am happy. All doors are open now.”Together with the National Council for Behavioral Health (National Council) and Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc. and Lundbeck,  affirms the need for localized, innovative, effective and sustainable approaches to address serious mental illness. Through (C4MH),a nationwide initiative, we have joined together to call for communities to prioritize serious mental illness and encourage promising practices that help people, like Chrystal, live healthier, fuller lives.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Megan's Story ",
    "description": "The children sat quietly in their first grade classroom completing a Thanksgiving coloring project. Most of the students at age 6 needed to improve their fine motor coordination, so sometimes coloring within the lines represented a challenge. When the brown crayon Megan used to color her turkey rolled over the line, she believed that her turkey was ruined. A disaster ensued.Megan uncontrollably leaped out of her seat and grabbed the box of crayons that lay on her desk. In anger, she screamed and threw the crayons one by one into the classroom wall with great force. Since incidents like this had previously occurred, the teacher, Mrs. Hill, was prepared. She used the school contact system and summoned the security guard.Within minutes, Megan was removed from the classroom and made to sit outside the principal’s office, as she had done many times before. Here she remained for the next 90 minutes until the principal believed that she was calm enough to return to class.As the months of the school year progressed, Megan became known as “the bad one” by both the teaching staff and the other first grade parents. With this reputation, she was excluded from birthday parties and play dates. When she became upset at a Brownie troop meeting and stomped on a cupcake that she had dropped, the troop leader contacted Megan’s parents and advised them that Megan was no longer welcome to be a member of the troop.Megan’s parents, Sandra and Daniel, became deeply concerned about Megan’s behavior and outbursts both at school and at home. Hyperactive and distractible, her tantrums frequently dominated her days. She seemed unable to focus or complete tasks assigned to her. In addition, she had trouble sleeping and kept them awake night after night. It was time to seek help.The evaluations seemed endless. They began with the psychologist and pediatrician. They continued with neurologists and specialists in the field of cognitive and executive functioning. Megan was questioned extensively to determine if she had been sexually abused, and given an MRI of the brain to detect abnormalities. She was also interviewed and tested by the special education team in her school.Time passed. No diagnosis, only ideas. And Megan’s life deteriorated as she isolated herself more and more from the pressures of her stressful world. Fearful of people and life outside the home, sadness and depression now dominated her thoughts.Sandra and Daniel had one more idea. Desperate, they made an appointment with a renowned child psychiatrist. Dr. Evelyn Smith led Megan to her private office and began with a series of questions.“Megan, do you ever hear anyone talking to you even though you cannot see them?”       Megan was completely surprised but seemed relieved to hear this question. A smile appeared upon her face. “Yes, I do,” she replied. “How did you know?”   “Is it just one person that you hear, or more than one?”“It’s always the same one.”“Does this person have a name?”“His name is Jason but I call him J.”“Does J ever ask you to do anything that you do not want to do?”\r\n\r\nTears came into Megan’s eyes and began to stream down her cheeks. “Yes, sometimes he tells me to hurt my Mommy and once he told me to kill my cat. But I love Mommy and my pet cat and I didn’t want to do it.” She folded her arms and buried her head in her lap.“When do you hear J speaking?”“All different times. I hear him in school a lot when the teacher is talking. I hear him in bed at night and I get afraid and can’t sleep because he scares me. Mostly I hear just J but sometimes I hear loud noises in my ears and I can’t get them to stop.”Dr. Smith completed her interview, and Sandra and Daniel had a diagnosis for their child at last: early onset , most likely caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain. Megan had been experiencing a series of . No one, including Megan, had understood what was happening to her. She did not know how to distinguish reality from the character that existed only in her mind.Megan had been experiencing the symptoms of an illness, but society had blamed her for its ravaging effects. Now Megan’s family needed to seek answers and learn how to provide for her special needs. This would be the only path to Megan’s chance at a normal life. First, Megan needed to be stabilized on medication. The second step was to work with the special education team in Megan’s school district to provide a safe and successful school environment with small classes and an appropriate IEP.The new medication successfully stabilized Megan’s moods, but it failed to address the issues of psychosis, and soon Megan began to have further experiences with imaginary beings. Her parents recall the day when they heard Megan’s screams coming from the bathroom.“Mommy! Daddy! Help me! I see them now. Come and look! The vampires are in the toilet bowl!” Her parents followed her into the bathroom to investigate, but saw nothing. Sandra picked up her daughter and hugged her.\r\n\r\n“It’s OK, Megan. There is really nothing there that will hurt you. The next time you need to use the restroom, come and get me, and I will be there with you always, to keep you safe from harm.”Dr. Smith responded to the situation by prescribing an antipsychotic. It is sometimes a risk when prescribing such medications to young children, as each individual reacts differently. Megan was one of those rare cases that had a life-threatening reaction to the drug. Within a few days after the initial dose, the muscles in Megan’s body tightened, leaving her unable to move or breathe. After 12 hours of unconsciousness in the emergency room, she survived.Megan’s journey through her illness did not end there. It was only the beginning. Trial and error of other medications ensued. When she was still not stabilized by the beginning of second grade, Dr. Smith recommended it would be best for Megan to be removed from the traditional school system, and home schooled during her second grade year. With tutoring and family support, Megan successfully completed the state mandated core curriculum of second grade, using her dining room as the learning center.More challenges lay ahead. With Megan’s wavering moods still out of control, as a last resort her parents placed her into a residential hospital for children. A team of doctors and psychiatrists monitored her behaviors and reactions to various medications. Sandra and Daniel longed for their child, and silence reigned through every hour and day that passed without their precious daughter.Six months later Megan returned home. When she did, a miracle happened. She had changed. Now she laughed and played and enjoyed the people around her. She was filled with love and hugs and the joys of living. She made friends and for the first time, had a chance to succeed. Megan was now ready to return to school.Sandra and Daniel had one more challenge in Megan’s recovery. They wanted Megan’s new school experience to be a positive one, so they petitioned Megan’s school district to pay for placement in a private school to address her special needs. Worried about funding, the school district refused. A year long court battle followed, as Megan’s parents learned how to navigate the legal system and fight for their child’s rights to an appropriate education. Finally, Megan was placed in the school where she belongs.Today Megan is 13 years old. This past June, she graduated from middle school and surprised her family when she was chosen to be the valedictorian of her seventh grade class. She proudly spoke from the stage, thanking her parents for their love, and her special teachers for their support and dedication. After her speech, the principal presented Megan with the President’s Education Award for her outstanding academic achievement.Megan’s story has touched the lives of all who know her. Family and friends who shared her journey have become enlightened about the stigma of mental illness in our society. They have learned that those living with mental illness can thrive and prosper with appropriate interventions and the ongoing medical research that is available today.There is hope.I am Megan’s grandmother.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "Being a person living with mental illness, I know the importance of voting.Legislators and politicians have an important stake in the quality of life for those of us with mental illness.  Between now and Election Day, Nov. 6, let’s show them clearly that .There was a time when I was severely ill, not being able to function at anything. I would lie in my bed all day, barely leaving my house. I couldn’t go to school or work. I had no social life. I was scared, isolated and discouraged. I needed help.Legislators and politicians have a strong influence on whether or not a person with mental illness recovers. Legislators and politicians make laws and determine the amount of . Much of this funding is directed towards Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security income and Social Security Disability Insurance programs.Without the funding for Medicaid, I would not have been able to afford the hospitalizations that I needed to restore my mental health. After my hospitalizations, I needed counseling and medication.Without the funding for  services through Medicaid, I would have never been able to access my needed therapy. Without the funding for Medicare, I couldn’t have been able to afford my medications, which initiated remarkable progress of my mental health.Without the Social Security Income program and the Social Security Disability Insurance program, I would have been unable to afford to live when I was so ill that I could not work.Legislators and politicians have also influenced mental health parity, which makes it mandatory that mental health coverage in health insurance plans is no more limited than primary health care. Clearly, this was essential to recovering and having a greater hope for my future.Legislators and politicians have influence on funding for research on  and housing for those struggling with mental illness. Research leads to innovations in state of the art medications. Housing has always been important to me, being integrated into the community and asserting my independence in society.I fear to think of where I would be without the needed funding for mental health care. Mental illness left untreated commonly results in unemployment, social isolation, homelessness and incarceration.Though there is no cure for mental illness, recovery is always available to people living with the challenge of mental illness. Today I can say that I have been employed, graduated from high school and college, lived in the community, and have a bright future. Without proper mental health care funding, none of this would have been a possibility.It is important that people with mental illness vote.

    "description": "By Simone   McKitterick\r\nBy Liza Long\r\nHudson Street Press 2014\r\nOn Dec. 14, 2012, 20-year-old Adam Lanza fatally shot 20 children and 6 staff members before taking his own life at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Prior to this, Lanza shot and killed his mother. When blogger and activist Liza Long heard about the shooting, her first thought was “What if my son does that someday?”Long then went on to post a response on her then-anonymous blog, The Anarchist Soccer Mom titled “I am Adam Lanza’s Mother.” The post went viral, garnering millions of likes on Facebook and thousands of retweets and email responses. The feedback launched an advocate career and the beginnings of Long’s book. In The Price of Silence, she introduces her son “Michael,” who lives with bipolar disorder and has rages that lead him through a labyrinth of hospital stays, previous multiple diagnoses and drug cocktails and juvenile detention.  Long describes her battle to get him a proper diagnosis and treatment, find a school that would accommodate his needs and keep him out of jail.Long’s book is a balancing act of two stories that is mirrored by thousands: children with mental illness and disabilities and the families who struggle against problems such as limited financial resources, difficulty obtaining diagnoses and policies that do not allow early intervention, giving rise to what Long describes as a “school-to-prison pipeline.”In Long’s own words, “The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA) required employer-sponsored plans to create parity for mental and physical health, but it did not extend that requirement to individual plans.” At the time she was writing this, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) had not been put into place. Things have progressed: in 2014, President Obama created the ACA to counteract against the limits set by the MHPAEA, and expand the rules for Medicaid, allowing more people to successfully apply.Yet too many children and adolescents are overlooked or outright dismissed as “not qualified” by the American mental health care system. Prisons have replaced hospitals as the only way to not only ensure the safety of families and the public, but to provide children (many of whom are nonviolent) with the services they desperately need. Long’s suggestions of community-based care, early interventions, integrated education and training of teachers and law enforcement officials have been cited before, but perhaps not from the view of a mother whose child has suffered the consequences of an inept system. In the end, Long asks the question “If there’s a poster child for cancer, why can’t there be one for mental illness?”We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "As an Army veteran who served in Iraq in 2003 and 2004, I saw many things. Some good, some bad but all would change my life forever. Now, when holidays come up I look at these experiences in a more hopeful light.This is what I would love to see for Veterans Day.On this day, our nation takes time to say “thank you” to recognize veterans and service members for their dedication to duty. In towns across this great nation there will be parades of veterans who have served in World War II, the Korean War, Vietnam, Desert Storm, Iraq, Afghanistan and some who have served in ways we will never know. They served us, only asking that our nation should honor the contract under which they enlisted.In the parades, you will see floats, nice cars and bands from all over. You will see military vehicles and flags from all of the different branches of the military: the Army, the Navy, the Marines, the Air Force, the Coast Guard, the National Guard, the Reserve, prisoners of war and those missing in action. It is an opportunity for civilians in communities nationwide to see where and when their family, friends and neighbors have served. Veterans’ services organizations (VSO) join the parade as vets serving their fellow vets. The parade in my town will have a representative of the NAMI Veterans and Military Council along with the Disabled American Vets (DAV), Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans’ Association (IAVA), AMVETS, American Legion, Wounded Warrior Project and others.On this day, I ask that you not only show your gratitude to our nation’s veterans by going to these events, but also think how you can help them directly. Every day, 22 veterans die by suicide. These people served our country and put their lives on the line for our freedoms. We can honor them better.Take time to learn about benefits and services available to veterans and explore what is still needed. Ask a veteran what would help them be more supported by their own community. Let them know you are with NAMI. Use your support group skills to listen if they want to talk about the issues that haunt them—and respect their silence if they don’t. If you recognize the veterans in your life today, when the next Veterans Day rolls around, you will have been part of honoring their service.From this veteran and NAMI, I would like to thank all veterans by standing with vets and their families in times of need as well as in times of good health. To NAMI, every day is Veterans’ Day. We honor and support our nation’s veterans year round. And like others on the NVMC, even though my time in the service is over, my time to serve veterans will never end.On this Veteran’s Day, in a country where people have made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure our freedom, I urge you to ask yourself these questions:Will you serve our nation’s veterans?Will you take time to understand them?Will you help them get the care they need and deserve?Will you help their families and love ones as well?Do it for the same reasons they did: to support the person standing to their left and their right; to make sure that you and I have the freedoms that we enjoy every day.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "By Simone   McKitterick\r\n\r\nBy Anna BerryRowman and Littlefield (2014)\r\nWhen you have a family legacy riddled with psychosis, paranoia and suicide, the odds of avoiding these symptoms yourself don’t look so promising. Fortunately, through acceptance and a staunch commitment to her own recovery, author Anna Berry overcame those odds.The book begins in the middle of one of Berry’s psychotic breaks. By this time, she has received many conflicting diagnoses from multiple mental health professionals and is living in a cheap motel, broke. We see her reminiscing on the events that led her there, including her family history. From the suicide of a great-great-great grandfather to her brother’s hallucinations, it’s clear that mental illness is very much hereditary in this family. Berry tells not only her own story, but also the story of how mental illness impacts an entire family. While Berry’s personal experiences provide context, it is the intergenerational narrative that makes her memoir come to life. When she describes her mother’s habit of driving the car around the block looking for corpses, or her brother’s severe avolition and susceptibility to scams, it is painfully clear how this environment led to Berry’s own psychological landscape. ’s timeline sways between her story and vignettes of the lives of her family members, highlighting the underlying theme of the book: Mental illness impacts everyone.Berry receives little sympathy from the outside world. Her mother’s psychiatrist recklessly prescribes pills without ever addressing the underlying problems. Her brother refuses to look for work and instead manipulates their mother for money. The HR personnel at Berry’s job threatens to fire her due to repeated calls from her drug-addled mother, who is paranoid about her finances. Berry’s husband resents her family’s manipulative behavior and has a difficult time sympathizing with the stigmas mental illness.Much of Berry’s personal struggles revolve around her romantic relationships. Despite having received multiple diagnoses, the one she identifies closest with is borderline personality disorder—a personality disorder characterized by severe mood swings, stormy relationships, impulsiveness and low self-esteem. The illness’s instability often comes with terrible anxiety, guilt and self-loathing, for which relief is sought at any cost. It is Berry’s interpersonal relationships that suffer most—from her habit of choosing emotionally unavailable men to her extreme mood swings that cause her to simultaneously cling to and push away the people who matter most in her life. The psychotic episode that opens the book is the breakdown Berry needs to reevaluate her needs.\r\nLike substance abuse, many people with BPD need to hit “rock bottom” in order to change their lives, and Berry is no exception. She realizes that her psychiatrists and exes were right: She has a mental illness she is unwilling to acknowledge. Berry resumes her college attempts at meditation and mindfulness on her own, takes up yoga and starts seeing a therapist who believes in a combination of spiritually integrated talk therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. Slowly, the fog of lifelong mental illness begins to lift. Today, Berry is a successful journalist and author. captures how Berry is able to break free from the cycle, and masterfully chronicles her family’s story. Berry’s own recovery is amazingly positive, but her ongoing fight to help her family members who still struggle is haunting.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "By Joni  Agronin   By Yochi Dreazen   A few weeks ago, I was scrolling through my Twitter feed and was really impressed by something I read. It was a tweet from the U.S. Army that said “It takes courage to seek help for depression.” The tweet included information about the veteran’s crisis line and a picture of a soldier with the headline—“A different kind of courage.”I was impressed by this tweet because it shows just how far the United States Military has come in understanding mental illness since the start of our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan., written by respected military journalist Yochi Dreazen, tells the story of the journey we have faced as a country growing and learning to understand mental illness in a field that depends on mental strength and stamina. But that’s the difference; mental illness has nothing to do with mental strength.Dreazen’s book primarily follows the life of retired Major General Mark Graham and his family. The Grahams lost one son, Kevin, to depression after he died by suicide when he was in college and another, Jeff, in combat in Iraq. The family was struck by the stark differences in the way their close military community responded to the deaths of their two sons and because of their love for both of them and for the Army, they have since devoted their lives to fighting the stigma that surrounds mental illness, especially in a time of war.Aside from telling an incredibly compelling story,  provides unique insight into what it’s like to actually live with a mental illness. Kevin, the younger of the Graham sons, was a promising ROTC cadet at The University of Kentucky who spent most of his life hiding his depression from his family and Army superiors.Dreazen’s chapter on Kevin detailing his life and ultimately his death paints an eye-opening picture of a person who was completely overcome by an illness. Kevin has two sides; the person that he wants to be and the person that he is when depression takes over. He was seeing a therapist and put on medication but eventually stopped taking it. He was planning on attending an elite ROTC summer program between his junior and senior years of college and was concerned about what the Army would do if they knew he was taking medication for depression.Kevin’s chapter really exposes the reader to the pain; the difficulty, the fear, the lack of understanding and the lack of control an individual living with a very real illness like depression faces on a daily basis. It is an invisible wound, one that many other soldiers also carry with them after experiencing the horrors of war.The pages of my copy of this book are stained with tears but I kept reading because I felt like it was wrong to not learn the stories of every soldier. Dreazen addresses deeply emotional and highly controversial issues delicately and through the eyes of his subjects without ever editorializing. He didn’t have to—the facts write the book.In 2012, more soldiers died by suicide than in combat. According to Dreazen, Senior Pentagon officials were slow to acknowledge the growing suicide problem and quick to underestimate its severity. In 2005, 87 soldiers died by suicide which was quadruple the number of suicides in 2003. The military was facing the consequences of years of underfunding for mental health care and soldiers returning from war were waiting months to get an appointment with a doctor.explains that members of the military have been facing posttraumatic stress (PTSD) since the beginning of warfare but it was just called something else. In World War One it was called shell shock. During World War Two it was known as battle fatigue.When Mark Graham started as a Second Lieutenant in the Army in 1978, stepping up to lead soldiers fresh out of Vietnam, it was clear that many of them were facing personal struggles. Mark came in to contact with soldiers self-medicating, mouthing off to officers and fighting with each other, all of which are traits uncharacteristic to healthy units. Many of them were likely experiencing PTSD, the Army just had no idea how to address that yet.The military estimates that almost 153,000 active-duty military personnel have been diagnosed with PTSD since 2001 and that number is unfortunately only growing. The good news is, it’s clear the military is taking steps to improve the resources available to individuals and families facing mental health problems. The tweet I saw a few weeks ago is proof of that. is a must-read for anyone who wants to see just how difficult it is to address mental health concerns in the military. It’s not a simple fix and there are a lot of factors at play. The most we can hope for is that by reading books like  and sharing these stories of both success and of loss can grow our understanding and inform our future decisions.Families like the Grahams and so many others who are raising awareness about mental illness and suicide in the military are making an invaluable difference. The more people speak out, the more it will become okay for others to ask for help.This Veteran’s Day, let’s remember that mental illness can affect anyone and our nation’s heroes are no exception. For those who are struggling or may be concerned about a loved one, there are  available.If you or a loved one is in crisis please call the Veterans Crisis hotline at 1-800-273-8255 and press 1.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "Ask anyone who has struggled with mental illness or addiction what the most important part of their recovery was and many times they will tell you it was finding a treatment plan that worked with them as an individual and not just as a part of the system.Person-first, or person-centered, treatment programs allow for people to work toward recovery at their own pace and utilize the resources that will best help them get better. Asten Jones who currently works in San Antonio, Texas knows from personal experience the importance of treating the whole person.Asten now works as a peer support specialist at  (CHCS), a position she said she was shocked to have been awarded after using services at CHCS herself.CHCS is one of four exemplary programs being recognized by , a partnership between numerous mental health organizations that promotes innovation in our communities to help those living with mental illness or substance abuse challenges. CHCS has pioneered the use of integrated services intended to holistically improve the lives of those with serious mental illness that were previously facing negative outcomes. CHCS has assisted more than 21,000 individuals through its numerous services and programs.Asten lives with bipolar disorder and struggled with heroin addiction on and off in different periods of her life. She was first brought in to the detox center at CHCS after her and her mother were caught doing heroin in the home of a woman her mother was providing hospice care for as a registered nurse.After completing detox, Asten was assigned a case worker from CHCS named Blanca Rosa who she explains completely changed her life.“I told Blanca was still doing heroin and still not taking my medication and she never threw me out,” said Asten. “She told me I had the capability to do great things, but I never believed her.”After Asten’s suicide attempt in 2012, she called Blanca who got her back in to a rehab program and stayed by her side for the entire journey. “She picked me up from homeless shelter and took me to rehab and stayed with me throughout the whole intake process so I wouldn't run,” Asten explained. “I stayed for 90 days and then called her again. I realize how rare it is for a caseworker to stay with you and she was really astounding.”During her recovery, Asten used five different services offered by CHCS including the wellness clinic, restoration center, in-house recovery program, case management and job readiness training.CHCS is having huge amounts of success with the community in San Antonio by offering these supports and more:In her role as a peer support specialist, Asten uses her personal experience to advocate for those who need help. “I like just being able to help them,” she said. “It’s a cross between being a friend and being an advocate. I am their friend but I am speaking out the loudest for them because I know what it’s like. I know what it’s like to be homeless and not have shoes and not have clean socks.”Asten said the integrated variety of services offered at CHCS is what truly makes it successful. “There is no timeline, they can go through any [program] as many times as they need and no one is going to judge them for that. I am going to have a mental illness for the rest of my life. Many people are dually diagnosed with mental illness and substance abuse and the center is willing to help them too, thank God.”“It’s really all about what the person wants. When you’re working with hundreds or thousands of people you need to be flexible and [CHCS] is,” said Asten.The one piece of advice that Asten would give to someone hoping to reach recovery: “Anyone can do it.”We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "For those experiencing psychosis, early identification and intervention matter—a lot. It lessens the long-term severity and often prevents psychosis from worsening. An effective early identification and intervention program should include the following coordinated array of services and supports:These services work so well because they are offered together to provide the skills and support that youth and young adults need to get better. They also take into account the context of a young person’s life and the key role that peers and families play in recovery.FEP programs reduce costly hospitalizations and put youth and young adults with psychosis on an early path to recovery.When you fund upstream interventions, you can prevent the tragedies associated with untreated mental illness: school failure, unemployment, hospitalizations, homelessness, jail and suicide. Investing in effective programs that intervene early produces far better outcomes for individuals, families and communities.There are effective strategies available, so why aren’t more young people getting help? One of the main reasons is that these services and supports are simply not available in communities. However, there has been progress made recently that to help ensure the availability of these resources in more towns and cities across the U.S.One significant event is that Congress has now required states to use 5 percent of their Mental Health Block Grant for First Episode Psychosis (FEP) programs. This means that states are obligated to set aside a certain amount of their federal funding to address the importance of early intervention.We recognize the urgency in expanding these programs. Our advocacy work and involvement in these programs is happening at all levels of the organization.NAMI NYC Metro is partnering with , an FEP program, in providing support groups and peer support for youth and young adults experiencing early psychosis. NAMI Connecticut is offering peer-run young adult support groups located close to FEP programs to make it easy for young adults to join. NAMI Minnesota has partnered with an FEP program and is creating education and support programs for youth experiencing early psychosis and their families.Oregon was an early adopter of these services and supports, having witnessed the success of these programs in Australia. Tamara Sale, the director of the  (EASA) in Oregon and a former long-time NAMI Oregon board member, shared how their program works successfully with youth and young adults experiencing early psychosis.The EASA program recognizes that it can be difficult to engage youth and young adults experiencing early psychosis, so it uses strategic community approaches that meet young people where they are with messages of hope and relevance to their lives. They are flexible and persistent, even with youth and young adults that seem entirely uninterested in mental health care.FEP programs exist in a handful of communities and more must be done to spread these programs across the country. Here is how you can make sure that happens.We can and must change the trajectory of people’s lives by intervening early with recovery-oriented and effective services.

    "title": "Should We Get Worked Up Over Halloween Costumes?",
    "description": "Halloween is big business. According to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $7 billion this year on festive celebrations, including pumpkins—new sets of pumpkin carving tools—and Katniss Everdeen, Ninja Turtle, Batman and Elsa and Anna costumes.Seventy-five percent of people will give out candy. About 40 percent will wear costumes—the average cost of which is $27. Thirty percent will visit haunted house attractions.Unfortunately, there are too many cases where haunted houses are set up as “haunted asylums” with depictions of people with  as violent monsters. Costumes also are sold of “mental patients” in straitjackets.Even worse are cases where a person will hang a figure in a noose from a tree in their yard—not knowing or recalling that someone who drives by every day had a son or daughter who died by suicide. Let alone the symbolism of racial and ethnic lynching that nooses represent.These kinds of costumes and attraction perpetuate the stigma that traditionally surrounds mental illness. They are offensive stereotypes. The U.S. Surgeon General warned 15 years ago that stigma is a major barrier to people reaching out for mental health care when they need it. People living with mental illness also internalize stigma, which jeopardizes recovery.NAMI loves Halloween as much as anyone. But would anyone sponsor a haunted attraction based on a cancer ward? How about a veteran’s hospital with ghosts who died from suicide while being treated for  (PTSD)?Last year, NAMI received many comments about protests over Halloween stigma. Most individuals and families affected by mental illness agree with them.“Portraying any individuals in a group as scary, wicked or dangerous because of an illness is insensitive, callous and mean,” said one advocate.Please be kind while enjoying this wonderful holiday, let’s not hurt anyone buy being insensitive to their problems. There are hundreds of other choices for costumes.”One person who lives with mental illness said that “haunts and bizarre things are just part of the holiday fun. Everyone is reinvented via costumes. I don't think we are singled out or stigmatized or made an object of, if people dress in a strait jacket.”One dismissed concerns saying that the world has too much political correctness.” Another recommended that we “pick our battles” and that there are bigger concerns.What do you think? Are some things okay while others are not? Here are some examples:Never underestimate the power of polite conversations by phone, email or social media to raise awareness.For costumes:For asylum attractions:Contact local newspaper editors and television news directors. Educate them also about misconceptions about mental illness and your concerns.If they have run promotional stories about a “Haunted Asylum”-type attraction, or related advertising ask them to also run a story about the “other side of the story.” Ask them to check out for themselves any offensive merchandise in a local store or bring a sample to a meeting.Don’t be surprised if some people react by saying “It’s only Halloween” or are even nasty. Take the high road. Stay polite and respectful in the public dialogue. Even if it seems that too many people disagree with your position, you win simply by raising awareness.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

By profiling and highlighting promising practices for those who live with mental illness, we are poised in our second year to expand and build on our early success as we continue efforts to  that ensure the best possible care is available for individuals affected by mental illness.Through the C4MH partnership, we were introduced this year to four outstanding programs, services and organizations that are going above and beyond to help individuals in their communities. Along with the other members of the alliance, The National Council for Behavioral Health (National Council), Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc. and Lundbeck, we identified four pillars that we believe would provide the most comprehensive and innovative care to those in need:Expanding on the success of our initial effort, this fall we introduced the Community Innovation Awards process to honor four programs that embody those pillars of success. We focused our lens to recognizing programs that presented promise and ambition to advance us past our current understanding of mental health treatment and recovery.More than one hundred applications were reviewed for the four awards, and today, the winners in each category were announced. As part of this recognition, they will receive a $10,000 award to continue their work and improve their services and will each be partnered with a  recognized by the C4MH initiative to support their work.We join our C4MH partners in recognizing the winners of our Community Innovation Awards for their efforts and for their commitment. These four initiatives and organizations stand above as examples of innovation and integration as they strive to do whatever it takes to ensure successful lives for those with mental illness. (Naples, Fla.) provides a comprehensive array of services to support individuals living with mental illness. The organization’s Health Under Guided Systems (HUGS) program, part of a broader mental health initiative known as “Beautiful Minds,” provides universal screenings to support the early identification of behavioral health problems in at-risk children up to age 18. The HUGS program has served more than 3,000 low-income, at-risk youth since 2010. (CTL) (New York) is the first free, nationwide, 24/7 text hotline for teens experiencing any type of crisis, including mental health-related issues like anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts. In partnership with select crisis centers across the country, CTL hosts a network of 230 trained counselors (as of November 2014), who provide individualized support to teens using CTL’s software. CTL has exchanged more than 3.9 million messages with individuals in need since launching as a pilot program in August 2013. (CDMHC) (Charleston and Summerville, S.C.) provides emergency services, case management, and evidence- based outpatient counseling and psychiatric treatment for children, adolescents, adults and families. CDMHC’s Assessment/Mobile Crisis Program (A/MC) offers the only 24/7 psychiatric emergency response and intake team in South Carolina, responding to critical mental health issues anywhere in the area that would otherwise go un-served. Between July 2013 and June 2014, the A/MC team helped to prevent 2,080 emergency department admissions, successfully diverting many of those patients to outpatient services. (RYC) (Moline, Ill.) is a comprehensive community mental health center and a fully integrated corporation within UnityPoint Health – Trinity. The RYC has partnered with the local Federally Qualified Community Health Care (CHC) Center in Iowa and Illinois to provide bidirectional integration of primary and behavioral healthcare for individuals with serious mental illness. Through this model, the RYC has helped integrate health services for individuals with serious mental illness, and has saved the state of Illinois more than $8.2 million in Medicaid costs since 2009.NAMI is thankful to the many organizations who applied for these awards. The work being done in communities across the country is inspirational  It is through these opportunities that we can continue to work together, to learn from each other and to strive every day to provide the best possible care for all individuals affected by mental illness.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "NAMI just released a report highlighting what went on in state legislatures in 2014 across the country when it comes to mental health issues. The report,  shows that investment in mental health services slowed from last year and that when progress was made around specific policy issues much of the legislation felt like it only skimmed the surface.This year, only 29 states and the District of Columbia increased funding for mental health services. Overall, the mental health care system still simply needs to recover lost ground from the state budget cuts of 2009-2012. But reinvestment is unsteady. See where your state fell in investment this year below.There were some victories this year. Minnesota, Virginia and Wisconsin were leaders in the country by passing measures that can serve as models for other states in areas such as workforce shortage, children and youth, school-based mental health, employment and criminal justice.Our policy recommendations for states in 2015 are: your Governor and State Legislators to let them know that they need to make mental health care a priority. with your local NAMI to see how you can help advocate for mental health services and supports in your community.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "Several years ago, in partnership with Dear Abby, a request was sent out in her newspaper column asking those with mental illness or family members with mental illness who had “interfaced” with the criminal justice system. I was part of a committee called Psychiatry and the Community, with the Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry, and received almost 3,000 letters.Each one was read and we decided a practical response was to develop a monograph entitled: “People with Mental Illness in the Criminal Justice System: A Cry for Help,” hopefully to be published soon with the help of the American Psychiatric Foundation (and available to the public, providers, and purveyors of care in the criminal justice system).The demographics of the criminal justice system are devastating. In a year’s time:The system is woefully understaffed and often poorly educated about the needs of those with mental illness.However, a few things about the criminal justice system became apparent as I read the letters.The document that was developed after reading this letters will hopefully offer guidance to mental health care providers on how to interact with the criminal justice system to advocate for skills development, provide training opportunities, develop partnerships and enhance care.In addition, the final product will provide practical advice for individuals with serious mental illness and their families on how to be prepared for an interaction with the criminal justice system.I’d be interested in hearing how y’all deal with these challenges and if these suggestions have been helpful.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Congressional Budget Bill a Mixed Bag",
    "description": "This past weekend Congress passed the “Continuing Resolution – Omnibus” spending bill () for the remaining months of fiscal year 2015 which runs through Sept. 30, 2015. The measure is now waiting for the President’s signature. This bill contains good news and bad news for mental health. The good news: HR 83 provides a small increase in funding for mental illness research. Bad news: the bill includes a small reduction for mental health services.The omnibus bill prevents any further cuts to funding at the National Institute of Mental Health (). Overall the National Institutes of Health (NIH) budget for 2015 will be increased by almost $150 million. NIMH received a budget increase of almost $17 million for a total budget of $1.463 billion for 2015. The bill also allocates funding to the NIMH as part of the President’s Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative. Multiple federal agencies and a number of foundations collaborate in the designed to release new technologies and undertake basic mapping of circuits and neurons in the brain.The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration () will receive a $39 million increase over fiscal year 2014 levels, for a total budget of $3.62 billion. However, most of this increase is directed to the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment to address the growing crisis of opiate addiction in America. Funding at the SAMHSA Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) will actually be reduced for 2015 – a reduction of $9.4 million out of total CMHS funding level of $1.079 billion. Almost every line item in the CMHS budget endures a small reduction, in most cases, less than 0.5%. Among the highlights of the final CMHS budget for 2015 are:Most programs under the CMHS “Programs of Regional and National Significance” (PRNS) would continue at levels slightly below their 2014 level. The total amount for 2015 for PRNS is $366.6 million which is a . Among these line items are:This bill regrettably does not include the increases put forward in President Obama’s 2015 budget proposal for programs. Back in February, the President proposed $301 million in additional funding for development of new permanent supportive housing (PSH). These new funds were projected to continue the program on a trajectory to end chronic homelessness by 2017. The President’s budget also called for a $25 million increase for the HUD Section 811 Project-Based Rental Assistance (PRA) program which supports the lowest income people with long-term disabilities to live independently in the community. The spending bill did not include either of these requests and instead provides only enough funding to renew the operating subsidies associated with existing PSH units in both programs. The bill does include an additional $75 million in funding for new rental vouchers for supportive housing for veterans experiencing homelessness under the Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) program.The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services are funded for 2015 at $45.2 billion – which will provide care and treatment for about 6.7 million veterans.This funding includes:The bill also includes $209 million to help address new costs related to the   – such as hiring medical staff and expanding facility capacity – and to implement the , which provides stipends and other assistance to families of seriously wounded veterans.To assist the VA in meeting its goal of ending the disability compensation claims backlog by the end of 2015, the bill includes $2.5 billion for the costs of processing disability claims. This level is a  from last year. Language is also included directing that $40 million of the increase should be used to support digital scanning of claims, to hire additional claims processors in regional offices, and for the centralized mail initiative. Funding for the Board of Veterans Appeals is increased by $11 million for a total of $99 million to address the looming appeals backlog.Finally, the bill contains $58.7 billion in advance fiscal year 2016 funding for the VA – the same level provided in the House budget resolution. This funding will provide for medical services, medical support and compliance, and medical facilities, and ensure that our veterans have continued, full access to their medical care.Want to become a NAMI Advocate?  for alerts so that you can raise your voice and help NAMI make mental health a priority in the halls of Congress and beyond!We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "“I’ve been trapped all my life not by man or by cages but by my own emotions. Where I’ve been, what I’ve seen while traveling inside myself can be summed up by one word: damn.Brandon Marshall is one of the NFL’s best wide receivers. He’s a 5-time Pro Bowler and has the NFL record for catches in game. His nickname is the Beast. But Marshall’s career hasn’t always been smooth. The Chicago Bears star was the subject of , on Sept. 19. This inside look at the NFL player offers a deeper look at his life and career—and his journey of living with  (BPD).The NFL is Marshall’s platform, but awareness is his purpose. BPD is frequently viewed as a disorder that affects females and means that you’re “weak,” but Marshall embraces who he is, owns up to his mistakes and takes full responsibility for his recovery. Before Marshall was diagnosed, though, it was a pretty bumpy ride.“There would be times where a switch would just flip and you’d be like ‘I don’t know this guy,’” Bears quarterback Jay Cutler says in the documentary. Cutler and Marshall started their careers together on the Denver Broncos and have found themselves back together on the Bears.Marshall acted up in practice and during games, disobeyed his coaches, sabotaged plays and received penalties that jeopardized his team—and career. Two NFL teams dropped him due to his antics. He also racked up two domestic abuse charges. He suffered injuries to himself too—even punching through the screen of a TV.Brandon’s mother says she noticed “outbursts and hissy fits” during his time with the Broncos. His mom and teammates approached him asking him to “grow up,” to “control” his behavior. His mother says “We still weren’t thinking something was clinically wrong—we were under the impression that Brandon could control this.”Finally after years of ups and downs, Marshall was diagnosed with BPD and was able to take control of his life.Marshall voluntarily joined a 3-month outpatient program at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., where he used treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) under the guidance of Dr. John Gunderson. Psychotherapy is the cornerstone of treating BPD and there is no medicine approved by the FDA for treating the illness, though some people will take medicines to control symptoms such as anxiety.After educating himself on his illness and continuing to engage himself in therapy, Marshall became a heavy-hitting advocate for mental health awareness. In 2013 he was hit with a $10,000 fine by the  (green is the color for mental health), spoke at the NAMI National Convention in 2012 and started the  in 2013. He and his wife Michi have a strong connection to  and  in Illinois. Michi is an avid NAMIWalk participant, and attended the NAMI Chicago walk last weekend and will be walking at the NAMI CCNS Walk on Oct. 18.By speaking out and proudly owning Brandon’s recovery, the Marshalls are becoming powerful advocates. Brandon’s willingness to use his public status to create understanding around mental illness is a quality I wish all public figures and celebrities tapped into.Speaking out is a choice and I can respect that, but every time we get to hear about somebody who overcame a mental health condition, it creates hope. It lets us know that even if you feel like the world is against you, you’re not alone if we’re dealing with something similar. It shows us how mental illness can touch anybody. And it can even save a life.During Mental Illness Awareness Week and the rest of Oct., the National Education Alliance on Borderline Personality Disorder is sponsoring a  to fight stigma: #BeyondBPDWe’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "I love Twitter. I use it every day for tracking all kinds of things like how  busy my morning commute will be, what my favorite brands and celebrities are up to and what’s happening in the news. I also use Twitter to express myself and my emotions through pictures, song lyrics and various emojis ;). From the time I have spent on NAMI’s twitter account I can say that I frequently see many others doing the same.There are  and that number is increasing every day. We tweet when we are happy and share our accomplishments. Some of us ask  (but really know the right answer deep down). Some of us also tweet when we aren’t happy, when we’re afraid, alone or going through a hard time.We know that people are sharing a lot of information on Twitter, so how can we sift through millions of tweets to see if people are asking for help?Researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Md. may have found a way. Computer scientists there have previously used Twitter posts to track flu cases and are optimistic that they can use the same techniques to track mental illness.According to , where JHU publishes their research endeavors, they have mined tweets from users who either mention their diagnosis or display particular language cues linked with certain disorders to quickly collect rough data on posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder and others.This technique can also be used to determine rates of mental illness in certain geographic areas. The examples they used included trends showing higher rates of PTSD found at military installations that frequently deployed and higher rates of depression in areas with high unemployment rates.Researchers say their goal is to share this information with treatment providers and public health officials. Maybe eventually we can even use this information to predict trends and set up resources to ensure that care is available as soon as people need it and not after it’s too late.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Depression: A Scientific Approach",
    "description": "“Of all the major illnesses, mental or physical, depression has been one of the toughest to subdue.” – Dr. Richard A. Friedman.Millions of teens and adults all over the world are affected by depression every year and it may be a more complex problem than we thought.With over 350 million people affected by depression worldwide, it’s no doubt an incredibly real and serious problem, but what exactly is going on inside a depressed person?“There might be something genetic about it”, Beverly Lehr, health sciences clinical professor and staff psychologist from the University of San Francisco. She talks about how depression might actually be hereditary and is usually misconstrued as a disease “you can just get.”In the past, depression was often described as simply a chemical imbalance in the brain. In recent years, scientists began to notice that the brain cell growth and connections actually may play a larger roll. The hippocampus region in particular controls memory and emotion and the longer a person has been depressed, the smaller the hippocampus becomes. The cells and networks literally deteriorate.Stress may actually be a main trigger in the increase of new neurons in this area of the brain. Interestingly, many modern drugs have an indirect effect on the growth of brain cells. This is likely why serotonin-based drugs seem to help some patients, but not for the reasons we once thought. Instead, they promote the release of other chemicals which ultimately stimulate neurogenesis.Some scientists now believe the focus should be on drugs which directly affect neurogenesis. However, while your neurons and chemicals may be the direct influencers, many genetic factors have been discovered as well. Every part of your body is controlled by genes. “If the genes get it wrong, they can alter your biology in a way that results in your mood becoming unstable.” Harvard Health Publications explains. Knowing this, we are informed how genes make biological processes and how they can alter your biology.Obviously, more research needs to be conducted in order to prove that depression could have be hereditary.“They are considered usually to be vulnerable to depression because of family history,” Lehr said. She explains how depression is a disease involving genetics. This is imperative because you can see if your parents or grandparents had depression and be better prepared. One particular study found that in a variation in the serotonin transporter gene leaves individuals more vulnerable to depression.So while the true cause or causes of depression are yet to be identified, it is important to remember that depression is a disease with a biological basis along with psychological social implications. It is not simply a weakness that somebody should get over or even something we have a say in. Just like heart disease or cancer, shedding light onto the subject is of the utmost importance in order to bring funding and proper research.Psychologist David Burns is quoted as saying, “Depression can seem worse than terminal cancer.” He tells us this because most people with cancer feel loved, have hope, and have self-esteem.Jan Silver Maguire, , shares, “I’ve come to understand that recurrent depression is my Achilles’s heel. There is also a strong biological component in my family; my mother and sister both struggled with severe postpartum depression. I know that medication alone is not the cure-all so I’ve expanded my arsenal of coping skills. I exercise, try to eat healthfully, volunteer, set boundaries like saying “no” when I need to, work on turning negative to positive self-talk, and cultivate an attitude of gratitude whenever possible. Some days are better than others, but that’s OK.”Jan shares her depression story on Anxiety and Depression Association of America (AADA) and explains her journey through her recurrent depression. Jan’s story helps truly understand some important information. She talks about how there is a strong biological component in her family which goes to show that depression stands on a biological basis.“It pains me that there are still so many misconceptions about mental illness because it prevents so many people from seeking treatment,” she writes. “It’s your life and you absolutely matter.” Jan provides hope for people suffering with depression, stating that they can get help. This lets us know, that even Jan, knows that there is hope for anyone who has depression. People shouldn’t stop when there is a better way to solve the issue.Although depression cannot actually be cured without medicine and more research, studies do show that just by saying ‘hi’ to a depressed person can make their day better. Try to say hi to someone who you know is not feeling the happiest in their lives. It is hard for people struggling with depression. Every aspect of life can be impacted.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

One of those 20-somethings is played by Josh Thomas, who is also the show’s creator. On the show, Josh’s mother lives with bipolar disorder and experiences suicide attempts as well as time in a psychiatric hospital which is based on Josh’s personal experience with his own mother.One of Participant Media’s goals with all of their content is to compel social change. The use of a comedy TV show is a unique way to spark a conversation about the importance of mental health care in America.NAMI screened clips from the show that displayed the affect mental illness can have on not only the individual with illness but also their family and friends. Following the clips we were able to have a meaningful and informative dialogue with Congressional staff, experts and NAMI staff.Josh, who is as hilarious and endearing in person as he is on screen, sat on a discussion panel along with Dr. Elspeth Ritchie, a retired Army Colonel and current Chief Clinical Officer for the D.C. Department of Behavioral Health, to discuss how comedy and TV can impact the image of mental illness in the U.S. Josh says his primary goal with  was to entertain, but the fact that people are getting some insight on mental illness without really realizing it is an added bonus.Jessica Hart, NAMI State Advocacy Manager and Alden Stoner, Senior Vice President of Social Action Campaigns from Participant Media were also able to weigh in and share their collective expertise on the importance of comprehensive mental health care from their different perspectives.The panelists fielded questions about a variety of mental health topics including health insurance coverage and criminalization. When one Congressional staff member asked a question about rates of mental illness in America’s prison system, Josh responded with shock. As a native Australian he had trouble wrapping his mind around the concept of putting those with mental illness in prison instead of providing them with treatment as they do at public hospitals in Australia. We feel the same way, Josh. is in its second season and this Friday’s episode is especially important to NAMI because it delicately and respectfully addresses Josh’s feelings about his mother’s illness. You will definitely laugh and you will probably cry too but we won’t spoil anything for you.

    "description": "As college students begin the new academic year, there is one subject that all of them should be focused on, regardless of their major.  is a subject that most people don’t talk about until a tragedy happens, yet it remains the second leading cause of death among college students. Campuses need to provide more education to stem the tide.It is National Suicide Prevention Month so there is no time like now to start. Suicides have devastated families and college communities across the country. The overwhelming majority of people who die by suicide live with a mental health condition. They need access to effective mental health services and supports as early as possible.How do we address this public health crisis? So often after a suicide, the community is left wondering, how did this happen and what went wrong? There is certainly more we can do. We can start with educating and informing college communities about the warning signs of mental health conditions, suicide and how to help a friend.In 2012, NAMI released , documenting the experiences of college students living with mental health conditions. Students who responded to NAMI’s national survey called for far more education and information about mental illnesses on campuses. They expressed the critical need to educate students, administrators, faculty and staff about mental illness.With this in mind, NAMI developed a  to educate and inform. It includes:There is great hope in the rapid expansion of  clubs across the country. These clubs raise awareness and advocate for better and more accessible mental health services and supports on college campuses. They make it OK to talk about mental health issues, decrease stigma and bring hope.People experiencing a mental health condition often feel isolated and alone. This can be especially difficult for college students who are away from home and under tremendous academic and social pressure. The more we can reach students, resident advisors, faculty and staff with information, the better equipped they will be to help. We can all play a part in lifting the shame and stigma that all too often hold people down.Together we can stem the tide. Change starts with us.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "I’m going to say to you what I wish I’d gotten a chance to say to my daughter. In 2013 she took her own life at the age of 15 due to severe depression. Since I’ll never be able to say these things to her, as part of me getting better, I’ll say it to you instead (thanks for listening):Just because I don’t understand you, talk too much and don’t listen, think I know everything (which I definitely do not), can be demanding and harsh, expect too much of you, and don’t show an interest in what you are into, doesn’t mean I still don’t love you. I get so worried about how I’m going to pay the bills, buy the groceries, make the rent and car payments, buy you the things you need like new clothes and stuff for school that I lose sight of you as a person. I start thinking of you as one more responsibility that I have to take care of-and that’s when I turn into a dreaded parent. I stop being , and I take on this super-mom attitude, and then we’re reduced to the parent and child, which isn’t working anymore, because you’re not a child anymore.You’re becoming an adult-and it completely throws me off. Your friends have become the people you talk to now, and suddenly I’m the odd man out. I’m supposed to know how to handle all this change, but I don’t, not really. I got used to being your best friend. I’m expected to let go one day like you’re a balloon, and let you fly like you’re supposed to, like I taught you to, like I told you to.But here I am, still holding onto this string, my fist just won’t let go. I see you growing into a sane and strong person, sometimes even stronger than me. But I can also see (because I’m older) when you’ve chosen the wrong path. It’s in these moments that I get worried and lose my cool. Instead of talking to you like , the understanding person that I am inside, I talk to you like a parent (which you hate), and suddenly I’m talking but you’re not listening because I’m lecturing.And I’m using that “know-it-all” tone because once, when I was your age, I faced the same kind of decisions-and got hurt. So really, when you look at it, the “mom-tone” is used when I’m feeling scared for you. In an irritating way, that should tell you I care. A LOT. I care enough to stop and lecture you, enough to stand up to you when you’re angry with me, enough to hug you when you go stiff on me. I probably care too much, which is why I either give up when you’re mad at me (because I really, really don’t want to alienate you), or I push too hard. It’s so frustrating, wanting to help-and feeling you can’t see me over my mom voice. Sigh.So here we are, you on that side and me over here, and both of us wanting the same thing-to be close, to have a healthy relationship. This has been a problem for every single mother and daughter throughout time, and they’ve had to work through it. Some do, and some don’t. Some mothers and daughters just give up trying to understand each other and stay estranged. Others keep trying, throughout their whole lives; trying to stand in each other's shoes.I think that’s what it takes to have a good relationship-any relationship: seeing for a minute through the other person’s eyes. When I stand in your shoes (and I wouldn’t want to go back to being a teen, not for a million bucks), I see a world that’s completely messed up. And you’re probably wondering how the heck you’re supposed to grow up to be normal in a society like this, where everything is depicted as perfect and romantic and enchanted, but where everything is actually screwed up, dysfunctional and crazy. Sometimes I wonder the same thing, and I’m an adult!When I stand in your shoes I feel like I don’t stand a chance, because I’ve grown up in a family where nobody understands me, and everybody’s busy with their own problems, and so it makes me feel like I’m gonna have to do this alone. And that thought scares the crap out of me. So I hook up with a boyfriend or a girlfriend, which is what I’ve been dreaming of, this amazing soul connection-only to find out they are messed up too, but at least I’m not doing this alone anymore.When I stand in your shoes I begin to get the sinking feeling that life is going to be this way forever-insane, confusing, frustrating, and just plain pointless. So I start to get depressed, because the world, which commercials tell you is just waiting for you to conquer it, is, in fact, unconquerable. As I look through your eyes, I see a world where everything is upside-down.When you’re depressed because the world and everybody in it seems completely untrustworthy, I want you to remember one thing, probably the most important lesson you’ll ever learn. It is: Life is hell not just for you, but for everybody-and that’s why there are so many crazy people in the world doing crazy things to hurt each other. So while you’re in your room thinking that nobody understands what you’re going through, I’m in my room thinking the exact same thing. Kind of ironic, isn’t it that we feel the same way, yet have such a hard time reaching out to each other?I’m in the next room feeling left out, misunderstood, pushed away and confused, just like you. I’ll try harder to be brave-to ask you for a hug when I need reassurance, and I’ll try not to pretend I’m perfect (because you see how messed up I can be). In exchange, I hope you’ll try to bust out of the myth that I don’t care, or you’re not important, because the truth is: YOU ARE EVERYTHING, everything that’s important to me. I just get scared to say it, just like you do, and I just get busy, just like you do. You see, we’re not as different as we thought.Here’s my motherly advice (this time, said from the heart): next time you feel like you can’t go on, please try and remember me. I’m probably just barely holding on, too. Maybe if we stand in each other’s shoes for a minute and are honest about our feelings, we’ll be able to get through this crazy hell-hole called life . I don’t know about you, but that’s all I really need-to know you’re on my side.Love you, imperfectly, but forever-\r\nMomWe’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "Thank you It’s rare that a national publication devotes a series about mental illness over the course of a year. But that's exactly what did.  In 11 installments, the newspaper published the series .The paper’s in-depth commitment to the topic has made an important contribution to national dialogue about mental illness—an issue that too often is neglected or subject to stigma. From how mental illness is subject to legal discrimination, to comedians using stand-up as education and therapy, to medical breakthroughs, the breadth and scope of content is vast. NAMI considers the series one of the most significant developments for mental health in 2014. As the nation’s largest newspaper, with a circulation of 3.3 million people, it raised awareness like few media outlets have ever done.“Many people that do not have personal experience with mental illness and our mental health system have said they had no idea regarding the lack of help, the stigma and the many that end up incarcerated,” wrote one NAMI California about the series. “One day another generation will look back at our mental health system today and be appalled at the dysfunction and lack of care for people suffering from severe mental illness.”“It was packed full of important newsworthy information to increase the general public's awareness of the plight of the mentally ill,” said a NAMI Florida member.NAMI worked closely with  on the series, providing research assistance and helping to find individuals and families affected by specific issues so that personal stories could educate readers. NAMI state and local leaders circulated the stories by email or social media to their members—as well as to legislators, law enforcement and others in their communities.On  the stories were shared an average of 1,600 times and had 2,200 likes. The buzz was considerable, help to energize conversations and advocacy at all levels.The series was journalism at its best—and a public service.Links to each story can still be circulated individually or as a complete series (See below). Send them to friends, advocates, policymakers and others. Encourage them to read the truth about the mental health care system.If news media in your community have not published or broadcast a series about mental health issues consider sharing  series with their editors or reporters as a model for the kind of public service they too can perform.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Is American Horror Story Stigmatizing or Just Silly? ",
    "description": "The new season of is set on the grounds of a 1960’s psychiatric hospital and, of course, uses imagery of a hopefully bygone era of psychiatry as practiced in a large, dehumanizing forensic facility. As the title indicates, this show is meant to scare or at least disconcert the viewer. Although there are many themes in the first episode, including the role of women, religion and sexuality, the show also uses classic horror props such as strait jackets, locked rooms, and forced electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).The staff members are generally portrayed as dysfunctional, at best. The clergy in the Catholic-run hospital all have personal issues and one doctor seems to be conducting brutal experiments. When patients “act out” the staff immediately retaliate with heavy-duty tranquilizers, restraints and ECT without any muscle relaxant or consent.The plot is most concerned with what society considers “normal,” and psychiatry represents society’s control of “abnormal” behavior. As such, the people sent to the hospital for treatment do not seem dangerous, at least in relation to the staff, merely different. For example, a white man in the facility is suspected of murder, but his true “crime” was marrying a black woman. Likewise, a female reporter investigating conditions at the hospital is committed for being a lesbian. While cases like these did occur, to medicine’s shame, there are no characters in the episode being treated for serious mental illness such as depression or schizophrenia.By some standards, the show could be considered stigmatizing. It does reinforce the image of psychiatric hospitals as using torture and retribution, but little in the way of treatment. While such actions happened, and still occur, the show portrays only examples of cruel and barbaric behavior by clinicians.One could also consider the use of straitjackets, restraints, and involuntary ECT as offensive and insensitive. These things are typically used to elicit fear in viewers, especially when the characters are wrongly subject to them.So, is the show stigmatizing? On the whole, it seems so over-the-top that viewers, even in the mental health community, might have trouble taking it seriously. Furthermore, from a consumer standpoint, the patients appear to be the least troubled occupants of the facility. However, the imagery and scenes might be traumatic to anyone who has ever been abused, neglected by the mental health system. For clips of the episode visit the .  Perhaps the only ones offended might be clinicians, although even their portrayals are exaggerated almost beyond belief.In short,  has an intentionally improbable plot on many levels. While it can strike a nerve with anyone who has been hospitalized or knows someone who has, especially in past decades, it is almost a spoof of life 50 years ago. Even so, it will be nice when psychiatry, even with all its faults, is no longer used as a symbol for all that is wrong in society.Viewers will likely have a variety of reactions to this show. Some may not be bothered at all, yet others may be greatly offended.

    "title": "Suicide Prevention: Can We Talk?",
    "description": " Of all the topics in mental health, one of the most difficult to consider is suicide. People contemplating it often do not speak directly of it. Families are surprised, stunned, mortified, angry, and devastated in the face of it. Non-mental health professionals may feel uncomfortable asking about anything related to it.  And mental health professionals feel helpless, as we are terrible at discretely predicting and preventing it. There are tragedies, and there is fear; suicide is at the crossroads when these two meet.As I review scientific articles, and program after program, the despair continues. In spite of more folks talking about it, more people training to identify it, and more programs put in place to prevent it, suicide continues.So what do we know? The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says . More than 800,000 around the globe die each year; many more attempt it. The figures boggle the mind, and challenge us all: how can we possibly intervene?Many of us know to watch for warning signs—a history of loss (social support, job, resources, health), prior attempts, family history, recent violence; changing appearance or behavior like plummeting grades or productivity, tearfulness, negativism, social isolation, drugs and alcohol); we’re not so good at communicating our concern or finding help.Programs like  from the American Psychiatric Foundation and  to name just two of the many that have been developed, frequently focus on training sentinels—folks in a position to observe people at risk—to heighten awareness of those with potential for suicide, and help find relief and support for the person in need. And yet, still we struggle.On January 9, an article was published in Lancet looking at the results of 3 different kinds of suicide prevention training on over 11,000 students in Europe: QPR, where teachers act as sentinels; ProfScreen, where mental health professionals provide screening, and the Youth Aware of Mental Health Program, which trains the students themselves. This program used “lectures, role playing, and education about mental health and suicide risk” with students. At 12 months, there was a significant reduction of suicide attempts, and of severe suicidal ideation, compared to the other control groups. It has been suggested that perhaps this program was more effective because it offers interventions “before there are outward signs of risk, and doesn’t stigmatize individual students.” It's an interesting idea: going to the at-risk population itself, giving them the education, and empowering them to make different choices.The CDC suggests the key to reducing suicides is to reduce risk and increase resilience. We cannot begin to reduce risk or abolish stigma or enhance resilience if we cannot even talk about the topic. We need a structured national conversation, an engaged public, an engaged media, engaged policy makers, and engaged legislators.How about a president who starts by mentioning the “dignity and worth of every citizen… (including) Americans with mental illness” in his State of the Union speech? (He did, last week!) How about asking every pediatrician and every primary care doc and every pastor and preacher (heck, place signs in every bus stop, subway, and grocery store for that matter) to educate each family to store firearms locked and unloaded, with ammunition locked separately, if a household member is at high risk for suicide? How about widespread movements to have the public certified in suicide prevention like so many of us are certified in CPR? How about offering  to every 9th grader to let them know about the warning signs of a mental health condition and what they can do? The list is endless.I know we all care. I’m ready to start talking, and doing; how about you?We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "Besides Voting, Let’s Talk with the Winners ",
    "description": "Election campaigns are supposed to be dialogues between candidates and voters. It’s very important to vote on Tuesday, Nov. 6 (or early if your state allows it), but it’s also important to keep the dialogue about mental health care going after the election.“You’re the boss,” said my congressman, U.S. Representative Jim Cooper, to me when I asked how comments from voters influence his position on issues. He’s got a point, although that does mean he has many “bosses” and I have to speak up to have an impact. So I email him regularly with questions and to express concerns. He always responds sometimes agreeing with me, sometimes not, often adding information to illustrate the issue. We continue the conversation at community forums and I visit his office from time to time.I’d like to share our recent conversation on the importance of voting. “I’m a hired hand with about 700,000 bosses. All of their thoughts are important and I try to make decisions that put our country first. It starts with your vote. These are difficult times, but we live in the greatest country on earth and we can solve our problems. It takes patience, moderation, a willingness to work with others, compassion for the most vulnerable and fact-based discussions about our nation’s future.” “Every vote counts. Some elections have been decided by just a few votes. It’s Americans’ civic duty to pick elected officials and we must all do our part.  Mark your calendar. Before work, after work, or between errands; make a plan to vote and follow it through. I took my 93-year-old mother to vote on the first day of early voting. We never miss an election.”  “Research is critical. If you don’t know the people on the ballot or the job description of the position, do a little homework. It’s important to make informed decisions so you can pick who would best represent you.”  “Check requirements to vote via absentee ballot by contacting your local election commission. Or, you can call a friend, family member or neighbor to see if they’ll join you at the polls. Many local organizations and political parties also provide free rides to polls.” Send introductory letters to newly elected officials and engage with their staff. It’s important to build relationships and begin a dialogue.”  “Again, research is critical. This is where your relationship with the staff comes into play. If you can’t find the answers, request a meeting and ask any questions that you have. My staff is here to serve the people of my district, and is always happy to answer questions that folks have.” Health care is a personal and often emotional issue. It’s important for elected officials to hear from the people they represent. It’s just as important for Americans to understand the laws being debated. Many emails that our office receives contain misinformation, so we spend a lot of time debunking myths and trying to help people understand how health care laws work. I would encourage people to call or write their elected officials not only to express their viewpoints, but to ask questions and to learn about health care bills. Congressional offices are always happy to answer questions from constituents.”  “Email is the most cost-effective way, but letters and phone calls are good, too. Our office reads each letter and email that is sent to us, so I can promise that when constituents write in, we pay attention to them. Each year we receive fewer handwritten, personal letters. While we read all correspondence, including form letters, it’s always nice when someone takes the time to write a heartfelt note.” Know the other side to your argument. If you want your elected official to support a bill, know how much it costs and how it is being funded. Know which groups both support and oppose it, and why. Elected officials have to weigh pros and cons of all sides before making a decision.” Like my congressman, I have already voted, so on Election Day I will help others get to the polls. After the election, he and I will continue our conversation. He probably will challenge me as much as I challenge him.That’s where all of us need to come in together. Elected officials need to hear first-hand about the real-life experience of individuals and families who have been affected by mental illness. They need to hear about barriers to care and about what helps and doesn’t help people. Statistics, legal and legislative analysis have a role when elected officials make a decision, but real, personal stories - brief and to the point – move both their hearts and minds.That’s how democracy works. Remember to vote, but also keep up the conversation after Election Day.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "NAMI and other advocates won a victory—at least temporarily—when the Federal Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the scheduled execution of Scott Panetti in Texas on Dec. 3, with only seven hours to spare.NAMI Executive Director Mary Gilberti expressed NAMI’s gratitude to the court, noting that Panetti has lived with severe  for more than 30 years.“The delusions and severe symptoms Mr.Panetti experiences every day have been unremitting since before his crime and have impacted profoundly on the course of this case.“In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Texas had applied too narrow a standard in assessing Panetti's competence to be executed and sent the case back for further consideration. This year, despite no additional competency evaluation, Texas once again set a date for Mr. Panetti's execution. Now, the Fifth Circuit has intervened expressing concerns about the complicated legal questions raised in the rush to execute Mr. Panetti.“After multiple rulings by courts and statements from individuals on all sides of the political spectrum that the execution of Panetti would offend all standards of modern decency, NAMI urges that the death penalty should be taken off the table once and for all in this tragic case,” Giliberti said.Ron Honberg, NAMI Director of Public Policy and Legal Affairs has been an advocate in the case for years, including the filing of an amicus brief with the Supreme Court, coordinating with .Three days prior to the Fifth Circuit stay, Honberg published a major  stating: “Panetti’s execution— particularly as the product of an unreliable legal process—would be immoral and serve no purpose, either in retribution or to prevent similar crimes.”National and international media interviewed Honberg about the case, including a joint TV interview on  with Panetti’s attorney, Kathryn Kase.At least 100 people with mental illness have been put to death in the United States and hundreds more are awaiting execution. NAMI has previously published , a report in conjunction with families of murder victims. The report gave voice to an \"intersection\" of concerns and made four recommendations:Proceedings in the Panetti case will continue.

    "description": "Mental illness affects young people at an alarming rate. One half of all lifetime cases of mental illness begin by age 14 and 75 percent begin by age 24.  What’s even more astounding is that even after an onset of symptoms, the average young person does not get treatment until eight to 10 years later.Donna Morton’s daughter lives with bipolar disorder. Even though she was diagnosed at age 12, it wasn’t until much later in her life that she finally received the support she needed from .After her first psychotic episode, Casey Morton was hospitalized for almost a month. “Toward the end of her stay we had to figure out what to do,” said Donna.  “She had broken up with her boyfriend who was also sick.  She couldn’t come home with me and she couldn’t live alone so we didn’t know what to do.” Donna happened to have a friend who worked for Henderson Behavioral Health and put her in contact with a woman named Celina King.  “This woman was a saint. She was so comforting and beautiful toward my daughter.” After her evaluation with Celina, Casey was accepted into their treatment program and moved in to their group home.  Donna remembers her daughter saying, “Wow, this is a program made for me.”Henderson Behavioral Health is an organization in south Florida that believes a focus on early intervention can make an invaluable difference in the lives of individuals with mental illness and their families. Getting young people the treatment and supports they need in a timely manner drastically improves their futures and can prevent crises and other challenges.Henderson is one of four exemplary programs being recognized by , a partnership between numerous mental health organizations that promotes innovation in our communities to help those living with mental illness. They have helped more than 700 adults each year live independent lifestyles in their supported housing program.Casey currently lives in one of these supported housing facilities and is doing very well.  “The model that they have, starts people with a high level of support and make sure that they stay there until they are ready to take the next step,” said Donna. “Structure is so important and has made a huge difference for my daughter, she has really benefited from that.”Donna said the greatest thing Henderson has done for her family is given them hope. “Sometimes the strain just becomes so much that you get worn down and wonder if things will ever improve but I have really seen maturity in my daughter. It’s really exciting for me as a mother watch the growth of my daughter.  It has taken her to a new level of responsibility for her own recovery.”With the help and support of Henderson, Donna says her family is able to really enjoy the time they have together now. “The impact of programs like this extends beyond the individual. It really has a ripple effect and impacts the entire family.”“You can get tied up with the negative sometimes but with assistance it takes things in a much better direction.”We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "title": "A New Act Will Help Those Affected by Mental Illness Save Money",
    "description": "The Achieving a Better Life Experience, or ABLE Act, was signed by President Barack Obama on Dec. 19. This new law allows some families and individuals to establish tax-free savings accounts for the qualified expenses of people with blindness, physical or mental disabilities without the fear of losing government benefits.Under the ABLE Act, people living with disabilities will be able to deposit up to $14,000 annually in a qualified savings account and save up to $100,000 without losing eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Setting up an account will not affect eligibility for Medicaid. The law also allows the account to earn tax-free interest. Funds in ABLE accounts can be used to pay for health care, education, and other expenses, including housing.However, in the final stages of the legislative process an important restriction was included on ABLE accounts: only people whose onset of disability occurred before age 26 will be eligible. This means that many adults living with serious mental illness will not be eligible for these accounts. It is important to note that the age of 26 is not related to the onset of illness, but rather the point at which the Social Security Administration (SSA) deemed an individual to be so disabled that they became eligible for benefits under SSI. For many adults with serious mental illness this is long after their initial diagnosis.Why was this restriction put in the ABLE Act? The cost. Earlier versions of the ABLE Act did not include this restriction on eligibility. However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that the cost would exceed more than $20 billion over the coming decade. With this age 26 eligibility requirement in place, the projected 10 year costs were lowered to $2 billion. This forced the bill’s sponsors to accept this restriction in order to pass the bill.NAMI will continue to work with ABLE sponsors in 2015, including Senators Bob Casey (R-Pa.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Representative Ander Crenshaw (R-Fla.), to remove this restriction.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "If your family is as far-flung as mine, the holiday season may be one of the few times of the year you’ll see some relatives. In my family’s holiday pictures, the kids usually look completely different from one year to the next! Maybe one of your relatives has changed too and unfortunately, may be struggling with a mental health issue.Possible signs may include a lower than normal mood, a lack of interest in family activities (withdrawal), crying spells or other symptoms of.As someone who struggles with anxiety, having my family’s support is critical. Before I was first diagnosed, I was very defensive about my symptoms, and would brush off people’s concerns (with some serious teenage attitude). Here is some advice I can share about helping someone you think may be in distress.Noticing a change in a family member can be uncomfortable. You may not know how to help or feel that it’s “not your place” to raise your concern with them, especially if it’s someone you don’t see very often. However, with respectful, empowering communication, you will be helping more than you think.Sometimes, a relative who is struggling will ignore questions, or will become angry. Remember, the only thing you can do is to let someone know that you care, that you are there for them and that you support them.I am so grateful that I have family members who offer consistent, patient support. I hope someone reading this will be able to offer such support to someone in their life this holiday season.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "More and more young people are speaking out about their experiences with mental illness and recovery and it’s helping to beat the stigma.We’re seeing more posts on Facebook and Twitter and more student advocacy clubs in high schools and universities.We’re hearing stories of success and hope from young people who are in recovery and eager to talk about it.Young adult leaders from the  affiliate are a great example of how peers are helping to create communities and schools where mental illness is recognized and recovery is supported.By involving youth leaders in outreach and awareness in schools, and by participating in community events and social media, NAMI Northern Virginia has been able to build a network of young adults who are passionate about telling their stories and helping others to get involved.This fall, NAMI Northern Virginia implemented its first  recovery education class just for young adults aged 18-28. The 10-week program is for individuals living with a mental illness who want to achieve recovery and maintain wellness through peer support.“Recovery is a process,” explained Lisa, a peer mentor for the local program. “Part of that process, I think, is getting outside of yourself to experience others and to share your experience so you can grow and continue on a positive path.”“It’s especially beneficial to be able to connect with those of your own age. The young adult age group has specific needs, and NAMI’s programs provide a space to talk through those issues with peers,” she added.Peter Davey, another peer mentor for the young adult class, believes that learning about mental illness early is important. “I think young adults are courageous in learning about mental wellness,” he said. “I suggest anyone take this important class to strengthen their well-being, rather than waiting until they are older to learn the material.”“Peer-to-Peer has helped me so much in life, and I always feel home during class learning with my fellow peers.”Others in the class shared what they have learned or had taken away from the young adult Peer-to-Peer class:Hope for recovery may be the most important take-away from NAMI Peer-to-Peer.Hope comes from opportunities to share stories, to make friends, and to make a difference in our communities. We have found that the determination, hope, and enthusiasm of young people are contagious. When other youth and families see that recovery is possible and that we can have fun while working together, it encourages everyone to get involved in some way.Another young adult said, “I am encouraged by the existence of this group to volunteer my time to help people with mental illness who are my age.”There may be nothing more powerful than peer-inspired hope and action from the grassroots of NAMI, and local programs made possible by the support of our community. is just one of the many NAMI affiliates across the country that are making strides in our efforts to reach more young people and families affected by mental illness.Anyone can get involved with NAMI by  to learn more about the programs and volunteer opportunities for individuals with mental illness, and for families and friends.There is still a lot of work to be done and stigma to defeat, but together we are making a difference in our communities as we celebrate hope for recovery!We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "It’s almost a week now since 20 children and six adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.America’s hearts are still broken.Although news reports have gotten many facts wrong over the last week, it seems clear now that the young man responsible for the tragedy had lived with a form of  since childhood.The tragedy has resulted in an enormous push for the country to make a sustained effort to provide real solutions to our mental health crisis, as well as gun control. The test is whether Congress, state legislatures and the country as a whole are serious enough to face up to the challenge.It’s not a new challenge. NAMI has been fighting on the mental health care front for many years, with victories and defeats. What’s tragic is that it has taken a horrible tragedy to wake others up.This past week, NAMI has been working 24/7 to stoke the momentum. We have given close to 100 interviews to national and regional media outlets. We are talking with Senators and Members of Congress about legislation in the coming New Year. NAMI State Organizations and NAMI Affiliates have circulated press releases and other information to their own networks.Again, it shouldn’t have taken a national tragedy to get this far, especially when we consider how many personal tragedies Americans affected by mental illness experience every year. and state legislators now.Keep the pressure on.Tell them they need to step up to ensuring mental healthcare.They need to make the availability of screening, early intervention, treatment, services and supports a national priority.Family education and support must also be part of mental health care. Too many families don’t fully understand the nature of mental illness,  if they are concerned about a child and how to cope.President Obama has  to use “whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens, from law enforcement to mental health professionals to parents and educators, in an effort to prevent more tragedies.”NAMI represents individuals who actually live with mental illness.We represent parents and other kinds of family members. We have a long track record working with law enforcement, educators and mental health professionals.We’re ready to work with the President.Is the rest of the country?Talk with your friends and neighbors.

    "title": "The Fiscal Cliff: What Does It Mean for Americans with Mental Illness?",
    "description": "Some call it a fiscal cliff, others call it an obstacle course. Whatever term you choose, our nation is facing an economic crisis.As part of the government’s budget process, Congress and the White House must agree on revenue and spending by Dec. 31. If they don’t, bad things will happen to the economy affecting the lives of all Americans. The fiscal cliff—and proposals to avoid it—may have a huge impact on children and adults with mental illness.Congress needs to  now.It’s about money: revenue and spending. In addition to the end of tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush, automatic across-the-board reductions in discretionary spending are set to take effect on January 2, 2013 unless the President and Congress agree on a different plan. “Discretionary spending” mainly entails defense and entitlement programs such as Medicare that Congress budgets for every year.At issue in the current debate is how to shrink the national deficit by $4 trillion dollars over the next 10 years. (The deficit represents the excess of spending over revenue. It contributes to, but is not the same as the national debt).After a bruising battle in 2011 over the national debt and the deficit, both parties in Congress and the White House agreed to what is called the automatic “sequestration” process.Sequestration puts enough sacred cows on the auction block to hopefully force agreement on more carefully chosen revenue and spending levels.If Congress  resources that are vital to people living with mental illness will take a hit of more than eight percent. That’s a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars. Here’s the list:Medicaid the state/federal partnership that finances health care for low income children, mothers and people with disabilities won’t be affected.  Also protected are cash benefits in Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Income (SSDI). Veterans’ services are protected in sequestration and in every alternative plan.Without going into detail, the tax cuts that have been in place for over 10 years are set to expire when the ball drops on New Years’ Eve. There are proposals in Congress to change national tax policy.How will the various proposals hit our personal wallets?Find out by using this  developed by the Tax Policy Center.By Dec. 31, the White House and Congress may agree to agree.  there is an agreement the goal would be to add $1.6 trillion in new revenue over 10 years and trim health spending by $340 billion over ten years. In a process known as “budget reconciliation” Congress will need six months to a year to draft legislation to tackle the deficit with revenue increases and long- term savings to entitlement programs.In addition to bringing in more cash by letting the Bush era tax cuts expire, a bipartisan grand bargain is likely to cut spending by changing Medicare, Medicaid and maybe income entitlements such as SSI and SSDI.While most members of Congress maintain these changes should not harm the most vulnerable beneficiaries, there is always a danger that an unrealistically high savings target could result in harmful cuts.Here are a few of the main ideas:Congress seems less likely to cut Medicaid than other programs, because it serves more than 60 million low-income Americans and promotes economic activity in state economies hit hard by the recession. But it is still a possibility. Some in Congress worry that cuts in federal Medicaid spending might make governors even  the federal-state program as allowed under the new overall health care lawGoing over the fiscal cliff would be bad news for programs many individuals and families depend on. In addition, a “grand bargain” that avoids immediate cuts to discretionary spending, would likely have long term effects on entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and perhaps Social Security Disability Income (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI).Contact your members of Congress  to avoid the across-the-board cuts to discretionary spending. Instead ask them to enact a “balanced” approach taking both revenue and spending into account.  In so doing, protect the most vulnerable by funding research and services that give Americans affected by mental illness the opportunity to recover and contribute to the vitality of their communities.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

It shook me to my core. I had sensed that she was sad and unhappy with her life but I didn’t feel that I was a close enough with her to explore further, to offer help or to acknowledge the sadness I saw in her eyes. I regret not taking a quiet moment to just sit and  with her as a friend in need of companionship, support and love. On a professional level it made me question myself; couldn’t I have done something to help her?No one is a stranger to personal tragedy or loss and these feelings can be amplified during the holidays. In this season of thanks we focus on the good and positive in life because that is the nature of this special time of year.With that in mind, remember to take good care of yourself, your friends and loved ones during this holiday. Taking a moment to check in with a friend or relative in a quiet moment, without provocation or motive other than to simply show you care can make all the difference for someone who may be struggling to maintain their emotional equilibrium.Life is fleeting and I have learned this past year that it’s often shorter than we anticipate for the ones we love. It’s easy to forget that between the punctuated moments of revelry and fun, there can be real pain and personal crisis that is all too alienating. Show those around you that you are thankful for their presence in your life and open yourself up to supporting and helping them when they need it.

    "description": "Having hard conversations in a relationship is never easy, but when you add a mental health condition to the list it can be even harder. This blog is going to talk about how to maintain healthy relationships when your friends and partners already know of your mental health condition, but may know nothing about it in your life. To learn how to disclose read this post on .Once you have disclosed your illness it is important to start building a safe space where you and your friends or partner can discuss personal things. In order to build a safe space you need to work on disclosing personal information about your condition that may help them better understand your struggles and needs. This can be done in small steps whether it is building the strength to feel comfortable telling them when you have doctor or counseling appointments or being honest if you have to pick up medication for your condition. These are small things in your life that will begin to give them an idea of how this is a part of your life, but also that you are willing to take the time to take care of yourself.The next step is getting to the point where you can discuss how much you want to talk about your illness and how you want to do it. You may just feel comfortable letting them know you have a diagnosis, but may not yet feel comfortable telling them all the gritty details. It is important to not only talk about your illness but to lay some ground rules for how much you feel comfortable sharing. It may be good to tell them that they can ask you questions but that you may not feel comfortable answering them all.The important place to get to is to be able to tell your loved ones when you are having a bad day due to your condition and to let them know how they can help you. By being honest you can begin to be yourself on the days when it is hardest to cover up your illness. This can make it okay for you to have a bad day without having to act strong or to act like what you may see as your version of “normal.” In building a safe place where you can begin to tell small things about your needs you can finally start feeling comfortable being yourself and build stronger lasting bonds with the people in your life.Linea is a recent graduate from Seattle University, with a major in English and Creative Writing.

    "description": "As yet another violent massacre occurs in our country—this one involving children, so it makes it all the harder to take—I pause to think about it, as I have done so often since the news broke on Dec. 14, 2012. During the chaos, ABC had on a senior medical correspondent, who was an M.D., stating that the tragedy and the gunman was “the face of mental illness.” I immediately took offense. Really? We knew virtually nothing about the shooter at the time, let alone whether or not he had a diagnosed mental illness. Yet, here was the media, already branding him the face of a disease that affects 57.7 million people in our country alone. That's a lot of “faces” that he is supposedly representing.It may come out, as the news continues to unfold, that mental illness did a play a role. Right now, we just don't know. As an organization, we are putting out the statistics to fight the stigma that will no doubt be a backlash from this tragedy—that people who have mental illness are much more likely to be the victim of violence rather than the perpetrator; that the overall contribution of mental disorders to the total level of violence in society is exceptionally small; and that it is important that we not make assumptions or speculate as to what the role of mental illness played in this situation at this time.However, it's hard for us as a society not to speculate, not to make assumptions as to the sanity of a person who would willingly shoot his own mother and then go into a school and shoot kids and the adults trying to protect them. It's hard for us not to jump to the conclusion that this was a “crazed gunman” who, at the end, took his own life.NAMI says that mental illness is an illness like any other. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a disorder of the brain. However, right now, I find myself questioning that. Is mental illness truly “an illness like any other?” Does diabetes make a person want to harm themselves or others? Does high blood pressure distort messages in the mind and make a person feel that they are called to kill? Does cancer create voices that drive a person to crime?Or, is this type of behavior unique to mental illness? Is mental illness, rather, “an illness like none other?” And should it be treated as such? Maybe it is, indeed, a very special illness that requires very special treatment. One that requires early prevention and intervention and that treatment should be wholly available to anyone who needs it.I have mental illness. I have not killed myself or anyone else, but I have caused harm. Not criminal harm, but harm nonetheless in the form of self-abuse and, at times, adversely affecting those who love me. At times, I have been very upfront in sharing my journey with mental illness. Other times, in certain circles of people, I have pretended that portion of my journey just doesn't exist. Maybe that needs to change.If any good can come out of the Newtown tragedy, it may be that mental health will be front and center on the nation's agenda. Treating mental illness, talking about mental illness, confronting issues that affect mental health will take as much precedence as treating and talking about other physical health disorders.But, in order for that to happen, mental illness needs to come out of the closet, out of the darkness, out of the impenetrable silence. We need to be able to simply talk about it in our country, in our state, our neighborhoods, and our families.The President has now called for a  on mental illness, which is supposed to be launched this spring. His proposal includes:These are all wonderful intentions; the test will be whether . For if mental health is not talked about, the downside of it is that the problems don't go away. Rather they can go underground, growing and festering until they come out the other side as something unrecognizable, unfathomable, and yes, tragic.The good news is that we know mental illness is treatable—in that way it is an illness like many others. We can't cure it yet, but living in recovery is possible. Remission is possible; as is relapse. It requires close monitoring and support, and often medications and counseling.Like Type 1 diabetes, dealing with mental illness is a lifelong process. Unlike diabetes, mental illness can cause some odd beliefs and behavior, but it is still manageable; tricky, sometimes, but ultimately treatable.And this is where the conversation should be headed.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "During the holiday season, you sometimes receive an unexpected gift from an unlikely source. This year I did, but it was not wrapped in bright paper or found under a tree. It was provided by NAMI and given freely from one family to my family. My gift was the NAMI Family-to-Family Education Program, and the life changing impact it had on my family.Over the course of son’s mental illness, I had spent countless hours and thousands of dollars trying to find help with little success. The , however, is different from anything I had experienced. The program’s presenters were trained by NAMI and each have the life experience of loving and caring for a family member with a mental illness. The free 12-week course includes up-to-date information about mental illnesses and effective treatments, including units on brain biology and stages of recovery. However, the most valuable aspects of the course, for me, were the insights into the experience of mental illness, and the skills that are taught to help manage its impact. This is where the program is strongest. This is the information that has the power to change lives and circumstances. These are the things you cannot know unless someone who has lived the experience tells you.On the first night, we learned that there are three stages of emotional responses we experience when struggling to cope with serious mental illness in our families and the emotional and practical needs we have at each stage. It was like a road map of where I had been, and where I was going. These stages are so relevant that after a few classes, I was able to recognize my own and others’ stages.We were presented with information about mental illness as a brain disorder in which symptoms are expressed as complex behaviors. The concept of a “double-edged sword” illustrates how unfamiliar, unwanted behaviors are expressed and many healthy, resourceful characteristics are lost when mental illness strikes; the husband who was always able to deal with minor problems is now unpredictable and overacts to everything; the daughter who was always responsible now acts in bizarre, inappropriate ways. Understanding the “double-edged sword” helps us to separate the person from the illness.Workshops focused on issues that are frequent challenges and offered practical, applicable skills and tools for me to put to use. In the problem-solving workshop, we practiced breaking down problems into manageable parts for focused effort. The empathy workshop helped me understand that my family member’s frequent refusal to take mediation and rejection of family support and community programs are driven by a need to salvage self-esteem.Thought disorders interfere with normal communication, and in the communication workshop we practiced essential communication basics. Keep communication content simple by using short, clear direct sentences. Manage the “stimulation level” when communicating. Communications are our “boundaries” when dealing with others; boundaries must be clear and strong.The members of the class included mothers, fathers, a sister, a brother, a wife, and a husband. Different backgrounds, educational levels, cultural groups, and ages were represented. Their family members struggled with a range of mental illnesses and were in different places in their recovery. Everyone was different, but, as I looked around the room, I saw a group of loving family members who were united in the battle against metal illness which was attempting to deprive their loved one of independence, relationships, hope and a future. They were all fighters. I was in good company.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "As I imagine most young adults feel, I started my first year of college with nervous anticipation. Going away to college provided a fresh start on a new life but also the pressure to make the most of the opportunity. Also, although I had an exciting future ahead of me, I still had the weight of my past with me that made campus life difficult.Growing up with a parent with  and brain damage had left its mark on me—I still often experienced anxiety, feelings of powerlessness and isolation while away at school. I still struggled to cope effectively and find people who could understand. I learned quickly that no amount of distance from my family situation could change how I felt or the fact that my childhood didn’t quite match up with those of my peers, which I realized more and more as I socialized with new people my age.I found hope while reading a campus newspaper article about student depression that mentioned , student-led mental health campus clubs. I knew immediately I had found an invaluable resource that could help me and others at my school.In my junior year of college, I created NAMI’s  campus club. Through it I established a wonderful supportive community that really made a positive impact on my life. The club empowered me to learn more about mental health and how to support my family while maintaining my own health. I saw directly how valuable peer support, self-advocacy and knowing you’re not alone can be.Through our club’ campus-wide mental health awareness activities, student-run discussion group and our partnership with NAMI Southern Arizona (one of many local  nationwide), I learned about the issues that all college students face when it comes to mental health and how I can help address these issues.As I enter my seventh year working for NAMI, I have learned a great deal about the mental health needs of college students. NAMI just recently published a  on the experiences of college students living with mental health conditions. The report is a blueprint for what students want. Here are some highlights:Students emphasized the critical need for the following services and supports to be available on campus:As the survey shows and as other countless research findings have shown, mental health issues impact college students and they need our support. Most will experience these issues for the first time in their lives while attending college—catching them by surprise and leaving them ill-prepared to handle these issues on their own. They are not seeking help because they don’t know where or who to go to or they fear being negatively perceived by their campus community.Every young adult deserves an understanding, helpful and supportive community like NAMI on Campus to turn to when life gets hard.That is why NAMI has launched a new NAMI on Campus initiative and our commitment to college students. The  website includes new resource sections to:Most of all, we want to hear more from college students—you! What resources, tools or information do you need to address mental health issues at your local college communities? How can NAMI help? Please feel free to email me at  with suggestions.Through my own life and my years working with young adults, I have seen firsthand how just one meaningful connection can really change the course of someone’s life.

    "description": "StrengthofUs.org, NAMI’s online community for young adults, has a new look for the new spring season and they are celebrating the positive changes with a #ThinkPositive social media campaign. StrengthofUs.org is designed to inspire young adults impacted by mental health issues to think positive, stay strong and achieve their goals through peer support and resource sharing.\r\n\r\nNAMI has recently redesigned and revamped the site with a fresh look and feel to make it more mobile friendly, interactive and user-friendly. The site also includes new activities, guest blogs and content posted by  administrators on topics young adults have shared are most important to them. If young adults create an account and log in, they can also see a bunch of stuff posted by other users like blogs, discussions, media, comments and wire posts. Also, StrengthofUs.org users get exclusive access to opportunities just for them.\r\n\r\nAfter three years of running the site, NAMI has seen time and again that positive messages have a big impact on the lives of young adults. In order to help spread the positive vibes, they launched the #ThinkPositive project, a social media campaign designed to inspire young adults experiencing mental health issues to stay strong and think positive, especially during difficult days. It is NAMI’s hope that the #ThinkPositive project reminds young adults across the country that they are loved, there is hope and they are not alone in their struggles. We are in this together!I decided to get involved with the #ThinkPositive project because I believe that the need for positive thinking is something that unites everyone. Whether you know someone struggling with a mental health condition or face one yourself, it is reassuring to know that sometimes a positive message is just what it takes to turn the day around. \r\n\r\nI myself live with .  Some days I feel overwhelmingly distracted, frustrated and discouraged. My understanding friends and family always manage to help get me back on track by offering encouraging and positive advice. I am so thankful for all that my community has given me and I feel it is only fair to pay it forward. \r\n\r\nI believe the #ThinkPositive project has the power to help eliminate stigma about mental health because it engages a wide range of people who share a common goal. This unity will contribute to the strength of our communities while tearing down the stigmatized boundaries and limitations of mental health conditions.\r\n\r\nHow to Get Involved\r\n\r\nNAMI needs our help spreading the positive vibes and making a difference in the lives of young adults! So here are simple ways to get involved today with the #ThinkPositive project:When my friend also got involved with the #ThinkPositive project, she said that “It is easy to get stuck in a negative slump, but it is even easier to share something positive.” I hope you find it just as easy to get online and start sharing some positivity.\r\n\r\nWhat do you plan to share?We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "Recently my family experienced a miracle. Not the type of miracle that draws massive crowds or gets noted in history books, but a miraculous experience that  we never believed possible. Tucked in a remote area of New England, overlooking the rocky coast, we witnessed my younger brother exchange vows with his wife. I can’t say whether it was the crisp ocean breeze or nearly a decade of tumultuous emotions being released from the internal box I have worked so hard to contain, but I have never felt such a powerful mixture of relief and joy. Part of this was a result of watching my parents, sisters and brothers; the collective awe of living a moment we once thought impossible. Mostly it was pride and joy for my brother, as he had found a trusted companion, a true love, someone who was excited to spend the rest of her life with him—despite his mental illness.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, my brother was in his early 20s and living on the west coast. He started to exhibit signs of delusions. Over the course of a few weeks, telephone conversations became more bizarre and it became obvious that something was happening to him. The speed at which he deteriorated was alarming, and my parents soon flew him back home to get a better idea of what was happening. Was it drugs? Was it alcohol? Was he sick? We had so many questions and fear started to saturate our thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe came to stay at my house the night he arrived. Opening the door to greet him is a moment that plays in my memory over and over again. Normally, my brother is tall—striking in fact—and has a truly contagious smile, but in that moment, he was hard, rigid and closed-off. He wore the black hooded sweatshirt—with the hood up to cover most of his face—that would become a constant part of his identity in the coming months. He seemed shorter, defeated and, most of all, scared. I reached out to hug him and was met with resistance, he wouldn’t make eye contact and barely said hello. I remember feeling a deep sadness. This is not the brother I once knew. What happened to him? What did he do to bring this on? This one moment, the simple act of opening the door and greeting my brother, for me represents the threshold of crossing into a world of a family member affected by mental illness.\r\n\r\nThe next few years were about survival, not only for my brother, but for my family. He was eventually diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. He struggled to interact with people, finding it difficult to even go into a store to buy a cup of coffee. He couldn’t make eye contact and conversations were brutally short. He continued to bounce around trying to find quality medical care. Our family struggled to be supportive, understand which behaviors were results of his illness and which ones were not. He repeatedly went off his medication and had episodes—or psychotic “breaks”—until he came to terms with the fact that he would need to take some form of medication for the rest of his life. It was a dark time. \r\n\r\nWhen my brother and I were young, people used to think we were twins. I loved being told this, because it reassured me that we had a special bond. His experience with mental illness has impacted me on so many levels, but mostly I felt like I had lost a sibling because this bond was broken. He barely talked to me and didn’t return phone calls. In all of my research, I found lots of support and guidance for parents of children with mental illness, but struggled to find support for the siblings, particularly, adult siblings. Unlike my parents, I wasn’t invited to doctor’s appointments or responsible for ensuring his basic needs were met. This at least gave them some direction and steps they could take. I also struggled to talk to other people about it. In addition to worrying about protecting his privacy, I quickly found that most people didn’t know how to react to a personal conversation about mental illness and felt uncomfortable, which in turn, made me uncomfortable. How could I help? Without an answer, I just kept calling him, visiting him and sending him emails. I tried to be supportive and maintain as much of our “normal” sibling relationship as possible.\r\n\r\nAnd then one day, years after that first melancholy greeting in my apartment, something was different. He smiled. He cracked a joke. He made eye contact. He was interacting with friends, and he talked about a girl he had met. The constant weight that was my new normal started to lift from my chest.\r\n\r\nWe haven’t found the cure. Certain struggles have become a part of the fabric of my brother’s life, and as a result, for all those that love and support him, but he has gained the tools to manage them and is thriving. In quiet moments, I have heard each of my parents and siblings mention the black sweatshirt my brother wore constantly those first few months. Looking back on it, I think it gave him comfort to hide beneath its threads. As we watched him get married, he stood tall with his head held high and no reason to hide. I have never been more proud of him or our family. In the darkest of moments, we refused to give up hope, demanded better treatment and in some situations, gave him the space to figure some of it out on his own. Not an easy feat for anyone, or any family, touched by mental illness.\r\n\r\nMy brother only wants to focus on the future, and rightfully so. When you have experienced such darkness, focusing on the present and looking to the future is the only way to live life. He is firmly grounded in reality, as is his support system, and we recognize that he will struggle again. He will always need to pay close attention to his mental and physical health to ensure he doesn't slip backward, and continue taking medication and seeking professional help. But for now, we will embrace the miracle our family has experienced. We will drink in all that we can of it, and live off its warmth and comfort for as long as possible. Because when you love someone who struggles with mental illness, that is all we can do: make the very most of the good moments and use them to build strength for the tough times ahead.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "By Brendan  McLean was the first movie in more than three decades to receive Academy Award nominations for all four acting categories. Add in nominations for best picture, best director, best adapted screenplay and best film editing, and it is understandable why many critics, and casual filmgoers alike, considered the film one of the year’s best. (The film ultimately only came away with one win: Jennifer Lawrence won the Oscar for best actress.)But beyond the nominations, awards and critical accolades lies what may be the film’s most lasting impact: the conversation that it has helped spur on mental health. Since the film’s release, director David O. Russell and the stars of the film, including Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro, have all spoken up about mental illness and placed a spotlight on a topic still not often openly discussed.Helping introduce legislation, meeting with Vice President Joe Biden and sharing his son’s own history with bipolar disorder—with his son Matthew at his side—Russell has taken the lead in raising awareness. In regards to the film, his directing creates scenes that, while fictional, appear to rip actual details out of the lives of those who have experienced mental illness themselves. Yes, the feverish story does come together nicely in the end for all those involved, which is not always the case for people living with bipolar disorder or other mental illnesses, but it accomplishes what many movies are supposed to do: provide a break from our own lives, make a connection and offer a little hope.NAMI was fortunate enough to be able to speak with Russell about the making of the film, his personal connection with bipolar disorder and his advocacy efforts so far.Many things. The script evolved the entire five years. At first, it was a rough adaptation of Matthew Quick’s novel, but then there were many questions I had to answer over time, such as how hard-hit this main character should be with his issues, because in the book he’s been away for four years. I didn’t know how to do that exactly. But I do know people who have been hospitalized for short periods, sometimes repeatedly. It was a process of defining exactly what Pat Solatano’s [played by Bradley Cooper] issues were and how they were visible and when. Also, there was the evolution of the father character, Pat Sr. [Robert De Niro], into a bookmaker from someone who in the book was an obsessive fan. Then it was deciding how the father was superstitious and had OCD.At some point I made The Fighter, which I was very grateful to get, and in the making of that movie I focused my affection for the specific enchantment of neighborhood worlds, in that case Lowell, Mass., and in Silver Linings Playbook, Upper Darby or Lower Merion, Pa. This became as interesting to me as the story. And the romance became very important to me, and how to back into that via the secret deal with the book, because in the novel, the Nikki [Pat Solatano’s wife] incident is withheld until near the end, and I did not want to use it that way; I preferred to give it up sooner, because it’s not so much about that incident as it is how he’s picking himself back up and putting his life back together in an excelsior fashion. Also in the book, his upward-attitude strategy was expressed through his love of movies and going over them in his mind. One film in particular was Rocky, but after I did The Fighter that seemed like not the best idea, and also I wasn’t sure about using movies inside of a movie.From my own experience, I know what many families go through and how much everyone has to step up. And how some people can be in denial of what’s happening, or not want to deal with it.He said the film makes him feel proud and that it is inspiring. It was a remarkable opportunity to make a film about experiences that we, and many other families, have lived. There is something healing in storytelling and inclusion.I find it hard to get through anything without a sense of humor, and this is especially true of the challenges mood disorders can present. While it is very helpful and important to have serious strategies and consequences in behavioral programs, it is also good to not take certain things too seriously because that can be seen as empowering the disease versus seeing through its intensity as illusory and not letting it become what is considered “real.”Absolutely—the film’s heart was informed by personal care and experience. It was all an atmosphere of embracing the family and the people in the family no matter what their issues, and all of it being dealt with rather than shunned.It was amazing to be in the White House in the Vice President’s office; he has known people who have suffered. As he himself was once a stutterer, and so relates to that, he felt that this film was an opportunity to open up that entire dialog. We spoke for a while about how people go through adversity of all kinds, and how families need help at a time when programs, schools and other supports are being defunded. It was a gift that Mr. Biden gave his time and blessings to the open embrace of those who deal with mood disorders and their families.Yes; it never stops. Just helping my own family means a constant dialog about how to get the right support, the right resources, the right set-ups, living situations, aides, attitudes. I know so many families who will deal with these questions for the rest of our lives. I can see what is needed: There is a need for so many more schools that can meet these needs, or resources within existing schools. And I can see the exact bridge programs needed to help the transition from high school into either college, or other programs, or a safe environment of work and learning and building a community.Mostly, I want people to come out feeling that it was a good movie. Part of that is feeling less afraid of talking about and dealing with and being warm and human about mental illness challenges—and wanting to do more.Work is very good. It’s important to be grateful for it and commit to it no matter how difficult. But it’s the people around me and a good meal in a home or a neighborhood restaurant. These are things I love.

    "description": " As you’ve probably been hearing, Congress is at . They have retreated, for the moment, from the issues that divide them, including whether limits should be imposed on assault weapons, if the loophole should be closed that exempts individuals who purchase firearms at gun shows from background checks, and other divisive issues.There is one area though in which the gun control and the pro-gun lobbies appear to have reached an agreement: that mental health background checks should be expanded. Some of the rhetoric has been inflammatory and highly offensive.For example, in the days following the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary school, Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president of the NRA,  by focusing on what he regards as the “real problem”: the large numbers of dangerous people with mental illness walking our streets.LaPierre said, “How many more copycats are waiting in the wings for their moment of fame—from a national media machine that rewards them with the wall-to-wall attention and sense of identity that they crave—while provoking others to try to make their mark? A dozen more killers? A hundred more? How can we possibly even guess how many, given our nation's refusal to create an active national database of the mentally ill?”But these offensive quotes are not limited to the NRA and their allies. Consider this statement by Mark Glaze, Director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a leading organization advocating for gun control, that appeared this January in an .“The system looks like Swiss cheese. It stops a lot of bad guys from getting guns, but it lets a lot of bad guys through. Every mental health record that isn’t in the system is a ticking time bomb waiting to go off in another community.”There is certainly little disagreement that guns should be kept out of the hands of people who are violent. But focusing the debate solely on expanding mental health background checks misses the point. After years of neglect, coupled with huge budget cuts since the recession began in 2008, mental health services are frequently not available to those who need them most. On any given day, six out of 10 people living with serious mental illness do not have access to any mental health treatment.Moreover, most people living with severe mental illness are not violent. Thomas Insel, M.D., director of the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH), :“Research has suggested that persons with schizophrenia whose psychotic symptoms are controlled are no more violent than those without serious mental illness (SMI). Nonetheless, when untreated psychosis is also accompanied by symptoms of paranoia and when it is associated with substance abuse, the risk of violence is increased. Importantly, the risk of violence is reduced with appropriate treatment. Moreover, people with serious mental illness are 11 times more likely than the general population to be victims themselves of violence.”Despite these research findings, existing laws take a broad, categorical approach to mental health background checks rather than focusing on predictors of violence. The Federal Gun Control Act states that “persons adjudicated to be mentally defective or who have been committed to a mental institution” are prohibited from possessing firearms and ammunition. And, states are directed to report the names of individuals who fall into these categories for inclusion in the National Instant Background Check (NICS) system.  by Mayors Against Illegal Guns shows that some states have reported thousands of records and others none at all. that federal legislation should eliminate highly offensive terminology such as persons “adjudicated as mentally defective” and provide clearer guidance on who should and should not be included, based on current scientific understanding. The real solutions however lie in improving America’s broken mental health system. A system that does not enable people to get mental health care until their symptoms deteriorate to the point of constituting acute emergencies is no system at all.NAMI has recommended a number of steps in the aftermath of Newtown, including:There are several bills in Congress that would take steps towards achieving some of these objectives, including the Mental Health Awareness and Improvement Act, which would put resources into school based mental health services, suicide prevention and other areas, and The Excellence in Mental Health Act, which would establish a funding stream for Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) that achieve certain core competencies in treating people with mental illness.However, at the same time that these new programs are being considered, vital areas of federal funding such as housing and research on mental illness are slated for cuts.Taking one step forward and two steps backwards is not going to get the job done. And, limiting the debate solely to how mental health reporting requirements can be expanded in gun background check systems will not solve the problem either.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

    "description": "By Eric  WardI was in my early 30s with three small children that depended upon me, when I lost my well-paying job. I went on COBRA insurance, but it quickly ran out. I was paying cash for my therapist, psychiatrist and for my prescriptions. Then my money was completely gone. I was losing my home and my therapist told me that he could not ethically take my money anymore. I was devastated. I had nowhere to turn.I was obviously nonfunctional at the time, as opposed to now where I am considered high functional, but my therapist gave me his email and told me that I could communicate with him via email for free. To sum it up in a few words; he saved me.I didn’t have the money for phone, computer or internet, but once a week I would ride my garage sale bike to my local library and email my therapist.This was the hardest time of my life and I needed help.I applied for social security and was denied again and again. I even lowered my head and walked into my local welfare office. For a proud father, this was the hardest thing that I have ever done. I obviously was doing the paper work wrong. I filled out the forms but my mind was scattered. I tried talking to the over-worked workers, and I know I made no sense. Obviously, I didn’t get anywhere at my local welfare office.It wasn’t due to the people that work in the office, or even the system. It was due to the fact that I desperately needed help. I needed someone who understood me and my mental condition. Someone who could help me get things in order, help me with the paper work and help me fill out the forms.I ended up ridding my bicycle around the small towns in my area looking for cans to turn into food money. I would use old plastic garbage bags and pick up cans, cash them in, and then go to the dollar store and buy food for my kids. (I’ll say also it is very hard to ride a bike and not get the plastic bag caught in your spokes!) I survived off of potatoes that the dollar store would sell.Through all of my mess, my therapist, Conrad Nordquest, was by my side. During the holidays I was desperate for money to buy my children gifts. I was going to sell my bicycle. He told me not to do so because it was my only form of therapy that was working. Conrad told me just to wait and something good will happen. It did, one night I had a knock on my door and it was some stranger. He asked if I was Eric Ward. I of course panicked. I had been off my meds and my  and  were in full swing. The strange man at my door gave me an envelope and then quickly walked away. When I cautiously opened the envelope it had $200 in it. Even though my therapist would never admit to it I knew that the money was from him. He was the only one that knew of my dire circumstances. Anyway, I was able to buy my children presents.But more than providing some money, my therapist was kind enough to take a personal interest in me. He would respond to my emails and council me through this very dark time. He got me an appointment with a top local psychiatrist, Dr. Jackson. Dr. Jackson did not charge me any money and did a full psych evaluation. He helped me file the paper work for social security and even gave me free samples of antipsychotic medications. I was approved for social security, and from that moment on it’s been “all downhill” (which is great for a bike rider!)Since that time, I’ve been able to start my own business, traded my garage sale bike for a new road bike, and have been in over 70 bike races and multiple charity rides. With a new business and three girls to keep me on my toes, I find time to cycle as often as I can. The sport allows me to clear my mind for some time, focusing only on what lies about 15 to 20 feet in front of me. For me, being on a bike is beyond exhilarating. It allows me to let go, gives me some great alone-time and helps me stay fit and sharp.Of course there are still difficult times, and proper medications and therapy is an ongoing process, but I will never give up! I will never stop, and I owe my success to my therapist and psychiatrist. None of this would have been possible without them by my side, and my wish for everyone is that you have someone, just one person like these two men, there to help and support you.As humans, it is important that when we see someone on the street, falling on hard times or just in a bad-off spot, that we realize this person may not know how, or may be totally unable, to get that help that is available to them. We need to help, and there are many things, even small things that we can do; at this moment and all the time. We can start by making it a priority to support the charities that are there for people in their time of need. Volunteering is every bit as appreciated as financial support, and as a cyclist and walker I know  and  organizers love seeing me and my family in attendance! If you have the means to support financially than please do. Take a stand! Be a champion and remind people that a mental illness diagnosis is every bit as real as a diagnosis of cancer. Treatment is available and recovery is possible. Fight stigma!What I want to say is that if I did not have these two people around to help me I would have been homeless. I would have lost my children. I would have lost my life. We cannot turn a blind eye to those in need of help, and there are so many things we can do to help each other.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!
